        description: "1066: End of the Dark Ages is a wargame of intermediate complexity, designed by Joseph Miranda, simulating the historic struggle to gain control of Britain during that crucial year of the 11th century.<br/><br/>That struggle saw the Anglo-Saxons, under King Harold, defeat the Vikings, only to in turn be defeated by the Normans from France led by Duke William. His victory eventually led to the establishment of the modern British nation. 1066: End of the Dark Ages can be played by two, three or four, each representing a different side: Anglo-Saxons, Normans, Vikings and Britons (the latter representing an amalgamation of the various peoples then indigenous to the island).<br/><br/>Each of the 12 game turns represent a calendar month. Each fully iconic, large-size, unit represents roughly 1,000 to 5,000 fighting men or key individual leaders along with their elite 'household' troops. Each square on the 34x22&quot; map represents 40 miles across, with all of England, Wales and southern Scotland, as well as the north coast of France, depicted on it.<br/><br/>Each player has a variety of military and political instruments with which he can attempt to gain control of Britain. Every tactic and stratagem available historically to the would-be kings of England &ndash; from diplomacy through treachery, the laws of fealty and homage, vassalage, appeals to the Pope, assassination, pillage, shield walls, fortification, heavenly omens, gold, spies, rebellion, navies and, of course, savage warfare &ndash; are again in play here.<br/><br/>The game contains one scenario, with adaptive rules that allow it to be played by two, three or four opponents. The rules contain approximately 14,000 words, which will allow experienced players to get through a complete game in about four to six hours.<br/><br/>",

New England has begun expanding into the Ohio River Valley but France has built a chain of forts extending from Lake Erie to protect their own claim on the land. Now fighting has erupted. France and its Native American Allies control the Ohio Valley but George Washington prepares an army to take it from them. A small war has started in the colonies between France and Britain but control of the world is at stake.<br/><br/>In 1754: Conquest &ndash; The French and Indian War, players play as the French and British Factions who fought for dominance over the Americas. This war is known as the French and Indian War in the United States, the War of Conquest in Canada and was part of the Seven Years War which was fought around the world by the European Powers. The French players either play as the French Canadian Militia or the French Regulars. The British players play as the British Colonial Militias or the British Regulars. Both players can ally and fight with the Native Americans but the French start with more Native Allies.<br/><br/>Players for each side work together in order to coordinate their strategies. To win, each side attempts to control Victory Spaces on the map that represent towns and forts. The militia players receive reinforcements from muster points while the French and English Regulars must ship their reinforcements from overseas. The game ends when the Treaty of Paris is signed and the side controlling the most cities wins the game.<br/><br/>1754 Conquest Introduces:<br/><br/>1. Strategic Forts - Forts allow defenders an opportunity to negate hits in battle!<br/>2. Valuable Muster Points - The new muster system for Native American and Colonial forces makes strategic alliances more dynamic and game changing!<br/>3.

        description: "1776 is a two-player, turn-based war game played on a hex grid map of the thirteen colonies and Canada.  It is primarily concerned with the military aspects of the American Revolutionary War. There is a basic game, various scenarios with advanced rules and a campaign game.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity Rating - 7<br/><br/><br/>(from the back of the box:)<br/><br/>The shot heard round the world at Lexington set off more than just another brushfire war in England's scattered dominions. It gave birth to a struggling new nation led by a comparative handful of patriots whose refusal to bow before tyranny set the tone for an American heritage preserved from defeat to this very day. But victory did not come cheap. <br/>After showing the British the color of their mettle at Bunker Hill, Washington's little army was plagued by one defeat after another, shunting from one battlefield to the next; always beaten but never destroyed. No power of the period believed that the upstart colonials and their unborn nation had the slightest chance of emerging victorious against the strongest military machine of the era after the dismal summer of 1776. But then came the cruelest winter of the decade when even nature seemed to join forces with the British against the tattered American troops. Undaunted, Washington led his small force in the historic crossing of the Delaware to twice surprise and rout British forces at Trenton and Princeton. Their resolve thus strengthened, the ill-clad Americans retired to Valley Forge to face winter beset by the hunger and deprivation that cost the lives of 2500 patriots. But the coming spring found Clinton facing a revitalized and strengthened rebel army which proceeded to chase him across New Jersey in the Monmouth Campaign. Reassured by news of the French alliance and the great American victory at Saratoga that fall, American troops dug in for what they knew would be a long and bitter battle for independence.<br/><br/>6 Games in One Package - Each a Realistic Simulation of the War for Independence...<br/><br/>1776, like all Avalon Hill games, is more than just the standard roll the dice and move game. It is a realistic simulation of the strategic situation faced by British and American alike in that fiery decade when the United States won its independence. <br/>Actually, 1776 is six games in one: a Basic Game that gets you quickly and easily into the routine of simulation gaming; an Advanced Game with scenarios that provides additional complexity and realism; and a Campaign Simulation Game that encompasses the entire war and balances successes in one region against failures in another - truly the ultimate in a simulation gaming experience! <br/>And if you don't have the time for a complete Campaign Game, there are four scenarios to choose from; each of which poses a challenge for everyone; from the most erudite of military historians to the fellow who just managed to pass American History:<br/><br/>Scenario 1: The Invasion of Canada - 1775 to 1776 - Can YOU do better than the bumbling General Schuyler and Benedict Arnold in the vain American atttempt to make Canada a 14th colony?<br/><br/>Scenario 2: The Saratoga Campaign - 1777 - Can YOU as General Horatio Gates surround and destroy the forces of the British General Burgoyne in this reinactment of the turning point of the Revolution?<br/><br/>Scenario 3: Greene's Southern Campaignv - 1780 to 1781 - Can YOU as General Nathaniel Greene lead Cornwallis' tested regulars on a merry chase with your force of rag-tag militia and Guerilla bands without being crushed in a major engagement?<br/><br/>Scenario 4: The Yorktown Campaign - 1781 - Can you duplicate Washington's encirclement and crushing defeat of Cornwallis in the battle that won the Revolution?<br/><br/>Contents: <br/><br/>     a 16&quot; x 44&quot; four-section, full color mapboard depicting colonial America from Quebec to Georgia; <br/>     two sets of die-cut troop counters representing over 400 units of Continentals, British Regulars, Rebel and Tory Militia, French Regulars, Indians, and naval units of the British and French fleets; <br/>     1 die; <br/>     1 Terrain Effects Chart; <br/>     2 sets (8 per set) of Tactical Combat Cards used in the innovative, new Sustained Combat system; 1 set of scenario, CRT, and play chart cards organized on an index-card format that puts a summary of all levels of the game at your fingertips; <br/>     a 32-page Rules &amp; Designers' Notes Manual telling you how to play all 6 game versions plus the inside story on research and development and why the game was designed the way it was.<br/><br/><br/>Rated &quot;Tournament Level&quot; on Avalon Hill's Simulation-complexity scale.<br/><br/>Note: 1st edition has 416 counters (this includes some blanks)<br/><br/>",

        description: "Part of David Schroeder's &quot;Der Weltkrieg&quot; wargame series.<br/><br/>Gorlice-Tarnow Breakthrough: May 1915<br/><br/>The head of the German armies, von Falkenhayn, wants the focus of the German operations in the war to be on the western front. Yet to make this a reality, he feels that relief must first be provided to the endangered Austro-Hungarians. Recent Russian pressure had almost cracked the final Austro-Hungarian defensive lines in the Carpathians, and new pressure was being brought to bear on Germany's weak ally by the Italians, who had just entered the war.<br/><br/>To help the Austro-Hungarians, a new German army is formed under the capable von Mackensen, and placed in the line east of Crackow. After a furious hurricane barrage, von Mackensen attacks and completely pierces the Russian lines. A Russian retreat ensues that enables the Central Powers' forces to recapture most of Galicia.<br/><br/>Von Falkenhayn wanted to stop operations at this point and shift to the west, but pressure from the Kaiser, at the insistance of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, resulted in a widening of the offensive. Attacks were then launched in the northern sector of the eastern front as well. Enveloped on two sides, the Russians reacted with their classic response, a retreat back into Russia, leaving Russian Poland to the Germans.<br/><br/>The Central Powers offensive wound down as they struggled to supply troops hundreds of miles past the supply heads. The offensive has saved Austria-Hungary from immediate peril, but it does not knock Russia out of the war. And instead of enabling von Falkenhayn to focus on the west, most of the newly created German forces are fed into the increasing vastness of the eastern front.<br/><br/><br/>The Brusilov Offensive: June 1916<br/><br/>In response to French pleas for help to relieve the pressure at Verdun, the Russian STAVKA authorizes a major offensive. General Brusilov plans attacks all along the front of his Southwest Army Group aiming primarily at Austro-Hungarian positions. His belief is that attacks across the width of his front will prevent the enemy from being able to quickly reinforce areas under local attack.<br/><br/>The Austro-Hungarians are caught off-guard as their focus is a new offensive of their own in Italy. The Russian attacks achieves numerous breakthroughs in numerous sectors and many Austro-Hungarian units are completely routed. The Russians take hundreds of thousands of prisoners and advance tens of miles, recapturing significant cities.<br/><br/>German reinforcements are rushed from the north and from Verdun. The Germans also take over command of almost the entire eastern front, and Austria-Hungary is placed in a subserviant position. The Russian offensive peters out as Brusilov's forces start to experience supply shortages, and Central Powers' resistance stiffens.<br/><br/>Brusilov had planned on support from Russian armies to the north to pin down German forces with attacks of their own, but they failed to support him. The losses mount and, after months of fighting, the Russians finally call a halt to further attacks.<br/><br/>The Brusilov Offensive did relieve the pressure on the French and it came very close to knocking Austria-Hungary out of the war. Had Brusilov been supported by his peers to the north, and by the Russian Allies (including the hesitant Romanians) the war might well have been won by the Entente in 1916.<br/><br/><br/>This game contains 2 scenarios covering the  1915 Gorlice-Tarnow offensive and the 1916 Brusilov Offensive.<br/><br/>NOTE: This is not a stand-alone game. It requires the ownership of Tannenberg: Eagles in the East / Galicia: The Forgotten Cauldron and Serbia the Defiant / Romania: Transylvanian Gambit to play.<br/><br/>20km/hex<br/>4 days/turn<br/><br/>560 counters (2 countersheets)<br/>3 small maps (4-5N, 4-5E, 5-5S)<br/><br/>Complexity = medium<br/><br/>",

A player must design his deck from the cards available for his side (a pool of over one hundred), with a minimum selection of 36 of them. Besides the cards belonging to one of the two sides, there are cards representing political and military objectives, for which the sides fight. Each objective gives victory points to the player who wins them. Victory can be achieved by military victory points, by political victory points, by a combination of the two of them or by the demoralization of the enemy.<br/><br/>The game is for two players, although some possible variants for four players are also provided.<br/><br/>There are different types of cards: objectives (political or military), characters, military units and management cards. Each side is made up of factions (ten factions for the Republic and eight factions for the Nationalists). A side may also benefit from having appointed a leader if certain conditions are met.<br/><br/>All cards have images from public Spanish archives and contain detailed historical information.<br/><br/>(A note on the language barrier: it's not as big as it seems. If your first language is French, Italian or Portuguese most game terms will be either the same or very similar. Even with English there are many easily understandable text parts.

        description: "1944: SECOND FRONT begins with the Allies well established in France following the D-Day invasions. The Allies are gathered to attempt their breakout and begin the race toward the German frontier. Each player has Combat Units and Headquarters available, and is capable of maneuvering across the map and engaging enemy pieces in combat. You must master the deceptively concise rules for Activation and Movement Point expenditure. And at any given time, you will face the decision of which army to Activate in any one phase - and your opponent will have an immediate opportunity to react . The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality. There is a track display that you use during movement/combat. As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions. It's easier to play than it is to describe.  For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.  The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).

        description: "From the author:<br/><br/>&quot;Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals. The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.<br/><br/>&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.<br/><br/>&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.<br/><br/>&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The German thrust had to breach the Soviet blocking position at Vasilevka before Operation Donnerschlag (&quot;Thunder Clap&quot; -- the planned breakout by the forces in the Stalingrad pocket) could begin.<br/><br/>57th PANZER KORPS The Strong Right Hook presents key military challenges to both sides: The Germans know where they must go... and the Soviets know it too; The Soviets must seek to stop the relieving advance in a contest of mobile forces where the Germans have the edge in skill, but not in numbers.<br/><br/>57th PANZER KORPS - The Strong Right Hook contains: <br/>one 22 by 34 inch map <br/>200 die-cut counters <br/>rules booklet in Counter Attack Folio Format.<br/><br/>57th Panzer Korps (CHS version) contains<br/><br/>one map (4 pieces)<br/>one rulebook<br/>one play aid card<br/>2 counter sheets, mounted but not die cut<br/><br/>',

        description: "In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.<br/><br/>History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.<br/><br/>Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had taken liberties with some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.<br/><br/>December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition<br/>1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs<br/>1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)<br/>1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)<br/>1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)<br/>1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board<br/>1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company<br/>1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       &amp; 86)<br/>1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)<br/>1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions<br/>1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro<br/>1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards<br/>2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast<br/>2006 - Lloyd's Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas <br/>2008 - Dated 2008 cardboard edition with chipboard board &amp; tiles, redesigned stocks &amp; money<br/>2016 - Dated 2016 The current affordable mass-market edition. It looks at first sight to be similar to previous modern editions, but has been criticised for the use of inferior design choices such as hard-to-read grey-on-grey embossed slots and the unusual tile fonts. It contains modified rules and a slightly smaller playing grid. Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson's original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it.<br/>2023 - Renegade Game Studio partners with Hasbro, and releases their new version, with Classic Mode or Tycoon Mode &mdash; play with or without tertiary stockholder merger bonus.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Across The Narva: The Soviet Assault on Estonia, February 1944 simulates the continuation of the Leningrad&ndash;Novgorod Offensive of January 1944, the Soviet Estonian operation pushed the front westward to the Narva River, aiming to thrust deep into Estonia. Stalin's main strategic goal was a quick recovery of Estonia as a base for air and seaborne attacks against Finland and an invasion of East Prussia. The German answer was a stout defence for the possession of the strategically important Narva Isthmus. Across The Narva is a board game depicting this event in time. The Soviet units established a number of bridgeheads on the opposite bank of the river in February. Subsequent attempts failed to expand their toehold. German counter attacks annihilated the bridgeheads to the north of Narva and reduced the bridgehead south of the town, stabilizing the front until July 1944.<br/> Across The Narva covers the first three months of the Narva Bridgehead campaign and utilizes the same system of command activation chit-pull and base rules as in Königsberg: The Soviet Attack on East Prussia, 1945 also by Revolution Games (II).<br/><br/>Across The Narva is a reimplementation of Army Group Narwa previously produced by Three Crowns Games.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: .8 miles / 1.3 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 12-page Across the Narva rulebook<br/>One dual-side printed Cover Sheet/Players Aid Card<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>Note: Players will need to supply one 6-sided die for play.<br/><br/>",

Lee, the other acts as Maj.Gen. Joseph Hooker (until June 28th) and then Maj.Gen. Geore G. Meade. Movement determined by command points which is determined by quality of leaders. Rules include the variables of replacing Hooker with Meade. There are two identical maps with each player having one and hidden from each other.

        description: 'ASL Starter Kit Module #4 PTO brings ASLSK to the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO), and adds the Japanese and the United States Marine Corps to the ASLSK lineup. ASLSK#4 is a self-contained ASL module that gives players the opportunity to start playing Advanced Squad Leader almost immediately.<br/><br/>ASLSK#4 expands on the themes of previous Starter Kits by providing new counters and updated rules featuring a new concept to Starter Kit &ndash; PTO. At the heart of this module are the rules for using the Japanese Imperial forces who fought amongst the jungle and island atolls of the Pacific in terrain completely different from the European Theater of Operations and with tactics different than their European counterparts. In addition to the step-reducing Japanese infantry and new rules for familiar looking terrain, simplified rules for Banzai, concealment, and hand-to-hand close combat are introduced. Neither components nor experience with earlier Starter Kits is necessary to play.<br/><br/>The eight scenarios and three mapboards cover actions between the U.S. forces (Marines and Army) that opposed the Imperial Japanese Army on the islands of the Pacific and in the exotic China-Burma-India theater. From Guadalcanal to Myitkiyina to the big island of Luzon in the Philippines, these forces fought to the death from 1942 to 1945.<br/><br/>',

Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to invasion, but the Comando Supremo (Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942.<br/><br/>Hostilities began on 13 June 1940, with an Italian air raid on the base of 1 Squadron Southern Rhodesian Air Force (237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF) at Wajir in the East Africa Protectorate (Kenya). In August 1940, the protectorate of British Somaliland was occupied by Italian forces and absorbed into Italian East Africa. This occupation lasted around six months. By early 1941, Italian forces had been largely pushed back from Kenya and Sudan. On 6 April 1941, Addis Ababa was occupied by the 11th (African) Division, which received the surrender of the city. The remnants of the Italian forces in the AOI surrendered after the Battle of Gondar in November 1941, except for groups that fought an Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia against the British until the Armistice of Cassibile (3 September 1943) ended hostilities between Italy and the Allies.<br/><br/>The rules use the basic The Europa Series system as a framework, with specialized rules covering the historical situation in detail.<br/><br/>Originally published by 3W (World Wide Wargames) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #128<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: half a month<br/>Hex: 32 miles / 51 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; 5 color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Africa Orientale rules booklet<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-6 Hours<br/><br/>Players will need to provide one 6-sided die<br/><br/>',

        description: "Description from BoardgameNews<br/><br/>In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?<br/><br/>The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.<br/><br/>Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).<br/>Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.<br/>Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.<br/>Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions...<br/><br/>",

        description: 'All is lost save Honour is a game about the campaigns fought during the Italian Wars (1494-1530), mainly between the Hapsburgs (the Empire) and the Valois (the French kingdom). The first volume is devoted to campaigns between Agnadello (1509) and Pavia (1525)<br/><br/>All began after reading Taylor&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Art of War in Italy 1494-1529&rdquo;, London, 1920. Soon that period looked extremely interesting to us and nearly neglected by the wargame community.<br/>Our intent was to generate any interest, among &ldquo;aficionados&rdquo; and historians, about that ancient era, when the first applications of modern strategy in the art of war took place.<br/><br/>This is the time of charges of cavalrymen with the finest gliding armors; of the first use of fire arms and artillery (with some effect); sieges, mercenary troops, treachery, pillaging and all that &ldquo;chrome&rdquo; that may enlighten a wargame.<br/><br/>Those campaigns were led to bring to &ldquo;the battle&rdquo;, which was often decisive, we decided to bring in a detailed sequence of the main battle (said &ldquo;Major Battle&rdquo;). So in the game, there are three kinds of battle: Major Battle, Skirmish and Siege with the Major Battle involving different tactics played by each side.<br/><br/>The map represents Lombardy in the XVIth century and the neighbors states. The sources for the maps were new books and old manuscripts and maps, among which a manuscript dated 1520 (!), regarding the state of the roads in the area between Lodi and Piacenza.<br/>Many books have been written about this subject and I think we have read the most important ones.<br/><br/>We had to make a selection of all those campaigns fought in Italy during the Italian Wars. The five campaigns we have included are:<br/>- Agnadello 1509, Venice defends its Republic against the foes. <br/>- Novara 1513, the Swiss against the French army. The last triumph of the Swiss.<br/>- Marignano 1515, Fran&ccedil;ois I grabs the Duchy of Milan from the Swiss<br/>- Bicocca 1522, the French lose the Duchy of Milan<br/>- Pavia 1525, Fran&ccedil;ois I loses the largest battle and Milan to the Empire<br/><br/>Game Highlights:<br/><br/>     new game system, operational-level, devoted to warfare in the XVIth century campaigns<br/>     highly interactive sequence of play, focused on maneuver and careful planning<br/>     various forms of combat: Major Battles, Skirmishes, Sieges<br/>     set of Exclusive Rules and specific rules and events for each campaign<br/>     a 22&quot; x 34&quot; fine-art map , reproducing a part of XVIth northern Italy, based on an accurate study of ancient maps and sources<br/>     gorgeous iconic counters representing all the main Capitani who fought there and the different combat units<br/>     detailed (as it is possible) order of battle, with combat units differentiated by strength, maximum movement, quality and reliability<br/>     very low counter density and limited play time<br/><br/><br/>(from Europa Simulazioni website)<br/><br/>',

New small unit tactics developed by the Germans, and the advent of the Royal Tank Corps for the Allies, promised a new set of doctrines that would rule warfare for decades. The question was: who would beat whom to the punch?<br/><br/>The Germans were fresh from a decisive military victory in the East against Tsarist Russia. The Allies were celebrating the arrival of fresh U.S. troops. Either side could claim victory if it could break the national will of the other.<br/><br/>All Quiet on the Western Front is another Ted Raicer design focusing on this often neglected war. For many years, wargame designers shunned World War I for a variety of reasons: too dull, too static, too hard to reproduce the suicidal wave attacks waged by both sides. Ted Raicer almost single-handedly put WWI back on the wargaming map with a number of designs, including Paths of Glory, Clash of Giants, and &quot;All Quiet...&quot;.<br/><br/>A traditional hex wargame, &quot;All Quiet...&quot; elegantly tackles a number of the key issues that help determine the outcome of the war, including German Stosstruppen and national morale, as well as more traditional elements like supply and command/control.<br/><br/>The game includes four scenarios: &quot;Operation Michael&quot; (an Introductory Scenario), &quot;Ludendorff Attacks&quot;, &quot;Allied Counteroffensive&quot;, and finally, the 30-hour campaign game, &quot;1918&quot;.<br/><br/>',

        description: 'The American Revolution: Decision in North America (AR), is a two-player wargame, designed by Joseph Miranda, in which you command the Americans or the British in the War of American Independence, 1775-82. The American player may also control French and Spanish units if those nations enter the war. Instead of the full campaign game, players may also choose to play the shorter scenario that ends in 1779.<br/><br/>Each inch on the area map, which covers all of North America from the Mississippi River east, including the Caribbean, equals 100 miles. Each brigade-sized unit represents two to four battalions (about 1,500 to 4,000 men). Each game turn represents one year. All the game&rsquo;s charts and tables are printed on the mapsheet.<br/><br/>The rules contain a total of 13,000 words, which works out to allow two experienced players to finish a game in four to five hours. The system can be fudged for solitaire play.<br/><br/>Rules cover such things as: initiative, rabble rousing, revolutionary political progress, colonial loyalties, the European balance of power, mobilizing new units, forced march, supply and forage, enlistment expirations, leaders, fog of war, fleets, French and Spanish alliances, Hessians, Indian sovereignty, fortresses and sieges, partisans, militia, overrun, massacre, political vs. military victory, frontier warfare, honors of war, grenadiers, light troops, detachments, regulars, and much more.

        description: "(from MMP's webpage:)<br/><br/>Angola recreates a brief portion of the violent, decades-long Angolan civil war that began in the 1970s with the fall of a colonial power and dragged its bloody way into the 21st century thanks in part to cold war politics.<br/><br/>Angola is a multi-player game in which players control the various Soviet- and US-backed factions that vied for control of Angola from 1975 to 1976. Originally released in limited quantities by Ragnar Brothers of the UK, Angola quickly became a rare and highly sought after game of almost cult status. Why? Angola features a number of innovative game systems that keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution. MMP is now updating this classic with the fabulous graphics of the IGS line of games and bringing it to a wider audiences.<br/><br/>The map is divided into areas, and units represent military formations and also special weapons, such as artillery, rockets, tanks, and airplanes. A unique command and activation system has players committing in secret to the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is like a tense game of poker, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.<br/><br/>The game is finely balanced, and all players frequently feel as if they are simultaneously on the verge of victory or defeat thanks to an ingenious victory point system that rewards good play for both sides and allows players to absorb reversals and strike back with the right countermove.<br/><br/>Angola contains:<br/>    2 decks of cards (110 total)<br/>    32 page full-color rulebook<br/>    2 player aid cards<br/>    22&quot; by 34&quot; inch map <br/>    3 countersheets <br/>    4 six-sided dice<br/><br/>Developer: Adam Starkweather<br/><br/>",

Scenarios cover the battles of Antietam, South Mountain, and Harper&rsquo;s Ferry. All can be linked to re-create the entire campaign.<br/>Each unit and commander which fought or could have fought in the campaign is rated for its movement, combat and leadership capabilities. The Confederates are vastly outnumbered, but boast fine commanders such as Robert E. Lee, Thomas A. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson and James Longstreet. The Union Army is fighting on its own ground and is much more powerful than the Confederate forces, but has difficulty bringing that might to bear. If they can, the war might end sooner. If the Confederates succeed, they might swing Maryland to the Southern side.<br/><br/>',

        description: "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>December 16, 1944<br/>After a period of fog, rain, and snow blankets the area, three German armies unleash 26 divisions against thinly held American lines in the Ardennes forest of Belgium and Luxembourg. The objective of the Germans is to push through the Ardennes, then cross the Meuse River and head for Antwerp. Hitler hopes to split the Allied armies apart and smash their vital supply port at Antwerp. Can the Americans stop them?<br/><br/>Historically, the German army trampled the American VIII Corps and penetrated within two miles of the Meuse. The Americans stubbornly fought the Germans at many critical crossroads slowing and then stopping Germany's elite forces. Historically, the German offensive achieved little except to create a &quot;bulge&quot; in the American line.<br/><br/>Ardennes '44 explores this fascinating campaign with a detailed order of battle and an extremely accurate Ardennes game map which covers the area from the Our River to the Meuse. Ardennes '44 covers the period from December 16th to the 26th. Two shorter one-map scenarios are included which cover the initial stages of the German attack. The Ardennes '44 game system is designed by Mark Simonitch, winner of the CSR James F. Dunnigan Award for Design Elegance and Best WWII Board Game of 2000 for Ukraine '43.<br/><br/>The result is Ardennes '44, a game that both the &quot;Bulge enthusiast&quot; and the casual player will enjoy. German attacks follow historical advance routes, and the Bastogne and St. Vith defense perimeters are often as large as they were historically (instead of one big stack of units in the town itself). The Allied player has a chance at holding Elsenborn Ridge and making the Germans pay dearly for the twin villages of Rockerath and Krinkelt.

He orders his division's motorized infantry regiment, the crack 8th Bersaglieri, to occupy three battalion strongpoints around a key cross-roads near the well (bir) of Gubi. The 8th Bersaglieri, supported by the reinforced divisional artillery, begins moving into position around Bir el Gubi and digging in. Most of the M13/40 tanks of Ariete 's understrength 132nd Tank Regiment are kept to the rear.<br/><br/>At the same time, General William Henry Ewart Gott, commander of the British 7th Armoured Divi-sion, orders the 22nd Armoured Brigade  (Brigadier John Scott-Cockburn) to attack the Ariete at Bir el Gubi, a complete change from his original orders for the brigade to secure Sidi Rezegh, 25 miles to the north. The reason for the change is still not clear: perhaps Gott hopes to give this well-equipped but inexperienced brigade an opportunity to season itself against an Italian formation that he assumes will be a weak opponent; possibly he just wants to clear his division's left flank before advancing. Whatever the reason, the full-strength brigade, equipped with 162 brand new Crusader tanks, is eager to emulate the Commonwealth's easy victories against the Italian Tenth Army die previous winter.<br/><br/>The stage is set for a swirling desert battle between evenly matched opponents.<br/><br/>Ariete covers this entire mobile action in turns representing 30 minutes each and a map scale of 150 meters per hex. Units range from sections to platoons. A minimal amount of special rules bring the Tactical Combat Series to North Africa, highlighting the unique tactical challenge of the desert environment.<br/><br/>The Italian player must manage a mobile defense against stronger British armored units until reinforcements arrive in the form of the 132nd Tank Regiment. He must make good use of artillery and AT assets (especially truck-mounted 102mm guns) to bloody the Brits and set them up for an armored counterattack.<br/><br/>The Commonwealth player must solve the problem of using an armor-only force to crack defensive positions held by a well-led combined-arms force.

The US 4th Armored Division in the lead performed a double envelopment of Nancy and is waiting for other elements to catch up.<br/><br/>For the German part, Hitler sees an opportunity to do two things simultaneously: To strike at the US spearhead stopping their advance and to try out his newly formed Panzer Brigades&mdash;complete with Panthers just off the assembly line but manned by crews fresh out of training.<br/><br/>The result was a classic defense studied by the US Army still today as the &ldquo;school solution&rdquo; of how to defeat an armored foe in a mobile set of battles.<br/><br/>Arracourt is a game of those battles with both sides using all the tools of mobile warfare with both sides maneuvering to attack and defend the ground of their choosing. The game is straightforward for the beginner BCS player and works very well as a starter kit before trying any of the others in the series yet is still challenging for the BCS veteran.

[It] has an historic scenario and six alternate scenarios covering the actual and potential events at Tobruk. After choosing a scenario one player takes command of the Allied forces and the other player the Axis forces.<br/><br/>Each turn represents 2 hours, each hex is 650 meters, and counters represent company size units.<br/><br/>Description from &ldquo;The SimCan Newsletter&rdquo; #2 Fall 1980<br/><br/>From March to December of 1941, the forces of Rommel&rsquo;s Africa Korps surrounded the Allied held fortress of Tobruk in North Africa but were unable to subdue it.  On 20 June 1942, Rommel got another chance to cut off Tobruk as the Allies retreated from the loss of the Gazala battles.  This time Tobruk fell and it did so in a swirling action lasting less than a day.  Assault on Tobruk depicts this situation.<br/><br/>The map covers the the entire fortress of Tobruk past its perimeter strongpoints in hexes equalling about 670 meters across.  Double impulse turns represent 2 hours and most units are of company size.  Seven scenarios are provided, one of the historic and the other six examining the various effects of improved Allied command control tactics and artillery coordination as well as alternate attack plans for Axis forces.  Assault on Tobruk is a fast playing game of low complexity showing an assault that could very easily have come out differently.<br/><br/>',

That fleet consisted of more than 5,300 ships carrying over 300,000 men and 50,000 vehicles. Opposing them was Germany&rsquo;s veteran Wehrmacht.<br/><br/>ATLANTIC WALL is a grand-tactical simulation of that campaign. The counters represent almost every formation that participated at the company and battalion level. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, commando, glider and headquarter units are fully represented. Features include Widerstandnesten (resistance nests), Cherbourg&rsquo;s fortifications and the all-important Bocage. The map portrays all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with the villages, towns and cities that formed the bastions of German defense. As always with this series, the orders of battle have been extensively researched to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides.<br/><br/>There are three introductory one-map scenarios depicting critical periods in the campaign that use an abbreviated set of rules while still maintaining the historical accuracy of the campaign game as a whole. In addition, there are three larger multi-map scenarios that allow players to either play a short period within the overall campaign or play the campaign from various starting points. The 6 June assault is covered in two modules, the Airborne Assault Module and the Amphibious Assault module, which allow players to recreate both the airborne and initial amphibious assault stage of the campaign. The Amphibious Assault Module is played on a special Beach Display that shows each sub-area of the invasion beaches with units depicted at the company level. It can be played as a solitaire scenario. The campaign game can be played from 6 June to 22 August, with a total of 234 game turns.<br/><br/>This is the third instalment of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (GOSS), the first two being: Wacht am Rhein and Hurtgen: Hells Forest. All three games share a common rules set that&rsquo;s been extensively updated and revised to simplify game functions while still maintaining the design of the earlier games. In addition to the basic rules, Atlantic Wall includes a set of exclusive rules to cover the special requirements of the amphibious and airborne landings and the logistical system required to support the armies coming ashore.<br/><br/>",

        description: 'Autumn For Barbarossa, (AfB) is a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game covering the the struggle to seize Smolensk in the late summer of 1941. This marks the end of the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa and the stabilization of the front until the effort to take Moscow in Operation Typhoon in the fall.<br/><br/>AfB features a small map area and a limited number of units, making it easily accessible for fast or competition play. The entire campaign finishes in 10 turns.<br/><br/>Play begins with the German offensive in full bloom. The German player attempts to rapidly seize as much of the map (in the form of Victory Point locations) as he can. Speed is essential; while he has several cities to reduce, he knows the clock is ticking before Hitler pulls the plug on his efforts. The commanders did not realize this was in the cards, but for design purposes we assume the player feels the pistol pointed at his head. The Germans have copious air and mechanized forces to accomplish their goals...for the moment. At some point determined by the &quot;Hitler Roll&quot;, the German mechanized forces are taken off the map, their air support is cut in half, and the Red counteroffensive strikes in an attempt to turn things around.<br/><br/>The Soviet player stalls, withdraws, and conserves his forces while letting the German offensive expend itself. As the high tide passes, he prepares his rebuilt Red Army for the second half of the game: the Soviet effort to blunt the German gains and recoup their losses as best they can.<br/><br/>It that was first published in Special_Ops magazine #7 (2017).<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 6 days<br/>Hex: 7 miles / 11.2 kilometers<br/>Units: Regiment to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory (Special Ops edition):<br/>One 16 x 28&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page Autumn for Barbarossa rules booklet<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3-6<br/><br/>',

Turenne operated in the northeast of France to join the troops of the Duc de Lorraine and the Spanish with hopes of regaining control of all the fortresses acquired in Cond&eacute;&rsquo;s cause.<br/>Sensing the danger of having such a great captain against him, Mazarin entrusted the command of the armies of Flanders and Champagne to the Comte de Plessis-Praslin (meanwhile beginning secret negotiations with the other camp). Plessis-Praslin lay siege to Rethel and, despite having given his word, the governor of Rethel surrendered a few days before Turenne&rsquo;s arrival. The commander of the Frondeur army was therefore required to combat the entire Royalist army.<br/>After his defeat (which would be the last one), Turenne joined the king&rsquo;s camp in exchange for amnesty, a few titles and, most importantly, the command of the French armies. He would be a loyal servant of the king until his death on the battlefield 25 years later.<br/><br/>&bull; The Dunes 1658 &ndash; 14 June 1658, The alliances had evolved since the end of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. The Lorraine soldiers had gone over to the French camp after their duke was imprisoned by the Spanish. Mazarin convinced King Louis XIV to sign a military alliance with Cromwell who sent a strong English contingency to the continent, thereby forcing King Charles II and Princes James and Henry to join the Spanish with their meagre troops. Exiled with those loyal to him for nearly six years, Cond&eacute; was also on the side of Juan of Austria, the commander in chief of the Spanish forces.<br/>When Turenne lay siege to the fortress of Dunkirk, Juan of Austria decided to give battle right away. Cond&eacute; declared to James &ldquo;Sir, today you will see how to lose a battle&rdquo;.<br/>As a result of this French victory, the Treaty of the Pyrenees and other related agreements were signed, putting an end to the Franco-Spanish War, to some extent the Fronde, and the English Civil War .

All the Royalist infantry, except the Swiss, was put in disorder. The attacks and counter-attacks would continue until Guise and Saint-Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s troops, passive until that point, overwhelmed the Huguenots.

He managed to surprise the Duke of Anjou, who had set off in pursuit of him, despite his strong defensive position. At dawn, Coligny&rsquo;s avant-garde progressed through hedges and thickets. The Royalist infantry, knocked about by the Protestant cavaliers, was beaten and their commander, Filippo Strozzi, taken prisoner. This victory would be a limited and fleeting one.<br/><br/>- Coutras 1587<br/>The eighth and final French War of Religion began with Henri of Navarre's first battle as commander in chief. Faced with the Royalist troops commanded by the Duke of Joyeuse, &ldquo;Premier mignon du Roy&rdquo;, Navarre took advantage of the night to position his troops near Coutras. At ten o&rsquo;clock, the charge of the Royalist gendarmes hit the first line of Huguenot cavalry despite the deadly fire of the artillery commanded by Sully. But the counter-charge of Navarre, Cond&eacute; and Soissons shifted the course of the battle and destroyed the morale of Joyeuse&rsquo;s troops. The ensuing massacre caused the deaths of Joyeuse, his brother, and numerous other noblemen.<br/><br/>See Avec Infini Regret wiki<br/><br/>",

        description: "Avec Infini Regret III - French Wars of Religion, 1562 - 1598<br/>The battle of Moncontour, 1569<br/><br/>The Peace of Longjumeau, signed on 23 March 1568, ended the second Wars of Religion but was fragile. The royal power no longer trusted the prince of Cond&eacute;, leader of the Protestant party.  A few months after the signing, the Catholics attempted to capture the prince of Cond&eacute; and Admiral Coligny by surprise. The plot failed and the Protestant commanders reassembled with their armies and took refuge at La Rochelle.<br/>Thus began the campaign constituting the third War of Religion at the end of the summer of 1568. The objective of the Royal Army, commanded by the Duc of Anjou, future king Henry III, was to seize the Protestant towns between Charente and Dordogne. After a winter campaign marked by desertions on both sides, the Duc of Anjou claimed victory on 13 March 1569 at Jarnac when the prince of Cond&eacute; was cut down in cold blood while surrendering to a Catholic nobleman. Coligny succeeded him as commander of the Huguenot army. Despite this victory, Anjou was unsuccessful in capturing the city of Cognac. Furthermore, he didn&rsquo;t have enough troops to supply a garrison in the cities seized from the Protestants.<br/>On 25 June 1569, Admiral de Coligny took his revenge and defeated the Catholics at La Roche-L&rsquo;Abeille where Strozzi, colonel general of the royal infantry, was taken prisoner. He then lay siege to Poitiers but was forced to abandon it after several weeks in order to confront the Catholic troops preparing to him from his rear bases.<br/><br/>On 3 October 1569, the two armies faced off near Moncontour.Gaspard de Coligny did not want to engage in battle, knowing he was outnumbered. However, German mercenaries among his troops were unhappy at not being paid and precipitated the movement. The Catholic troops were better prepared, greater in number and more heavily armed and easily pushed back the assault of the Protestants who were forced into a disorderly retreat.<br/>Although it barely lasted two hours, this battle resulted in between 6000 and 10.000 men dead or taken prisoner on the side of the Protestants compared to 1000 for the Catholics.

Other elements of this new Axis &amp; Allies variant include a card deck with three card types -- Orders, Tactics, and Fortune -- to add depth and complexity to play. Order cards determine play sequence and break turns into distinct phases; Tactics cards offer players varied strategic opportunities; and Fortune cards add an element of unpredictability.<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies D-Day begins as Operation Overlord, the invasion of German-held Normandy, is underway -- 130,000 soldiers of the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States are poised to assault Fortress Europe. You and your fellow world powers control their fates.<br/><br/>One player controls Germany, whose Axis forces have turned the beaches of Normandy into a near-impenetrable stronghold. Set to breach those defenses are the Allies: the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The future of Europe and the world hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies D-Day is designed for two or three players and can be played in two hours. Axis &amp; Allies D-Day is the third Axis &amp; Allies variant, following the successful Axis &amp; Allies Europe and Axis &amp; Allies Pacific, both of which were published in 2001.<br/><br/>',

Your goal: successfully complete a tour of 35 missions and return home a hero for bringing the war with Japan to a close without a bloody hard-fought invasion of the homeland.<br/><br/>Your missions will be varied: high level, low level, day and night. You will face fighter attacks, flak, searchlight spotting, and bad weather; not to mention damage to your aircraft to include a shattered windshield and compromised cabin pressure, loss of oxygen supply, damaged landing gear, knocked out navigation or communication equipment, ruptured fuel tanks, inoperable machine gun armament, and just about anything else that can go wrong with a 100 ton aircraft flying 1,500 miles to its target only to be met with fierce resistance from a determined enemy.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        description: "Backgammon is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years. Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.<br/><br/>Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.<br/><br/>The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.<br/><br/>It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game.&quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).<br/><br/>The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.<br/><br/>",

        description: '&quot;Baltic Gap: Summer 1944&quot;, depicts the Soviet drive into Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania during the summer of 1944. As the game begins, the defense of Vitebsk, a Byelorussian fortified city located just a few hexes beyond the southeast corner of the playing surface, has just collapsed. 1st Baltic Front is advancing westward through the shredded German line, and will soon threaten all of Army Group North with encirclement. Finally, after four months of fierce battle, the Red Army will win the great prize of this campaign, Riga, and pocket the enemy in the Courland region of Latvia.<br/><br/>Baltic Gap allows players to explore this interesting campaign from a variety of historical and hypothetical vantage points. Long campaign games can be enjoyed by up to five players. Several short scenarios are also provided, and these work best with a single player per side.<br/><br/>Baltic Gap is the 11th wargame in the award winning Operational Combat System (&ldquo;OCS&rdquo;). It stays true to the ground breaking earlier games in the system that allow players a deeper glimpse into why the skills and behaviors of the two sides were so very different. Here in 1944, we find a much more developed Russian army (much more advanced than the one shown in the 2007 CSR Award winning game Case Blue) facing a still potent German Wehrmacht. The Germans will need to fight their forces with great skill to avoid getting swamped by their tough adversary.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 3 to 4 days<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8.0 Km<br/>Units: Battalion to Army<br/><br/>Game Inventory: <br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; Full Color Game Maps <br/>Five countersheets (1,400 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>One 48-page OCS Rulebook <br/>One 48-page Baltic Gap specific Rulebook <br/>Two 4-page OCS Charts and Tables Booklets <br/>2 6-sided dice<br/><br/>',

        description: "Publisher's ad copy: &quot;Baptism By Fire: The Battle of Kasserine, February 1943 chronicles the first real ground operations by the US Army in the ETO in WW2. Every wargamer knows this battle was a severe Allied setback. What is not obvious, however, is that Allied troops on the ground gave a good account of themselves against the remnants of Rommel's vaunted Afrika Korps, despite the ineffective and confused leadership that existed at Corps level.<br/><br/>&quot;In the end, while GIs and Tommies fought their guts out to make up for the mistakes of their leadership, the advantages achieved by initial Axis successes were allowed to blow away in the wind by an equally detached and confused Axis High Command. In its case, how to best exploit the results of their initial attack depended on an argument raging within the Italian Commando Supremo and the persuasive abilities of Albert Kesselring and Erwin Rommel. After much discussion and the loss of several crucial days, the Axis decided on the less ambitious plan, which was itself no longer even possible.<br/><br/>&quot;Baptism By Fire is the second game in the Series: Battalion Combat Series (MMP), which took players by storm with its block buster initial release Last Blitzkrieg: Wacht am Rhein, The Battle of the Bulge. The game is designed as a more accessible entry to the system for those who want something smaller and faster than the earlier monster game. Here the wide open desert, limited number of Formations, and short scenario length provide players with a rapid and fun introduction to the series, the chance to develop their play skills to become a more effective BCS player overall, and to take a good look at this poorly understood battle.<br/><br/>&quot;Once again, the masterful order of battle research by Carl Fung showcases the forces involved with more fine detail than ever before. As a result, the common misconceptions of hapless GIs and Afrika Korps supermen is put to rest.<br/><br/>&quot;To give players a better feel for the pulse of the battle, the Germans run rampant for a few turns but then must idle back for several more while their commanders figure out what the overall objective will be. The player selects this objective randomly in the middle of the game, and it determines his Victory Conditions. This precludes the Axis player from overusing his limited combat power beforehand (since he might be going down the wrong road, literally) and keeps the Allies off balance as they must protect against both possibilities.<br/><br/>&quot;With a campaign game of only 10 turns, multiple plays are readily possible and various strategies for both sides can be explored.&quot;<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>    Kasserine Campaign, 2 maps, 10 Turns<br/>    Operation Spring Wind, 1 map, 4 Turns<br/>    Mid-Campaign Start, 2 maps, 5 Turns<br/>    Between a Rock and a Hard Place, 1 map, 5 Turns<br/>    End Campaign Start, 2 maps, 3 Turns<br/>    High Water Mark, 1 map, 3 Turns<br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    BCS rulebook (version 1.1, in full color)<br/>    Two BCS Charts and Tables<br/>    BCS Crib Notes Booklet<br/>    BBF Game Specific rulebook<br/>    Two 22&rdquo; x34&rdquo; Full Color Game Maps<br/>    560 Counters (one sheet of units and one BCS marker sheet)<br/>    6 scenarios total, 3 one-map scenarios<br/>    Box and Dice<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Turn: 1 day<br/>    Hex: 1 mile<br/>    Units: Battalion (w/a few Companies)<br/><br/><br/>(description from MMP website and user)<br/><br/>",

        description: "Historical Setting<br/>June 1941 -- Army Group Center hurls itself through the Soviet border defenses, and its two Panzer groups race headlong toward Minsk. Behind them lie the remnants of the Soviet Western Front -- almost a million men in four armies. The Soviets are stunned by the German Blitzkrieg. Their responses are slow, confused, and governed by pre-war contingency plans made obsolete by the speed of the German advance. In little more than a week, the German panzer spearheads meet east of Minsk. Though isolated units continue to fight, the entire Soviet Western Front has ceased to exist!<br/><br/>The Germans' next target is Smolensk, but the Soviets resist more effectively. Entire armies are dispatched from other parts of the Soviet Union as the true scope of the Minsk pocket disaster and the magnitude of the German threat become known. Soviet counterattacks, especially around Lepel, are thrown back with horrific losses. Once again the Panzer Groups charge eastward, creating yet another huge Soviet pocket west of Smolensk. The Soviets resist savagely. Smolensk falls on July 13th, but the pocket does not close. Many Soviet units escape to fight another day.<br/><br/>Hitler now makes a fateful decision and overrides his generals. Over half of Army Group Center's armored and air formations are diverted south to take Kiev or north to isolate Leningrad. No longer under heavy pressure, the Soviets gain time to form solid fronts around Vyazma and Bryansk. Did Hitler's decision cost the Germans the war?

(1995) is the progenitor of these games, and its system is quite similar, but it is unfortunately subtly incompatible with the later games.<br/><br/>While not simple, these games are also not overly complex and present an excellent simulation of the early war. Most of the details of the campaigns are covered in a playable manner. Perhaps the most obviously interesting detail is the sequence of play, which is asymmetrical to account for the difficulties the Soviets labored under. Make no mistake, the Soviets are going to take a lot of abuse, but this is no walkover for the Germans and both sides are interesting to play.<br/><br/>(BGG user description)<br/><br/><br/>Errata counters contained in Barbarossa: Crimea.<br/><br/>",

        description: 'On June 22nd, 1941, Army Group North, the smallest of the three German army groups, drives forward into the Baltic states. Its objective is Leningrad. Once the crown jewel of Czarist Russia, Leningrad is now the second most important city in the Soviet Union. Its array of ordnance factories includes the massive Kirov Tank Works that turns out most of the heavy KV-1 and KV-2 production for the Soviet Army. Loss of Leningrad would deprive the Soviets of a major population and industrial center and give the Germans the advantage of position in any drive against Moscow from the northwest. <br/>Army Group North, short of Luftwaffe support and motorized forces, is the only army group that fails to achieve a significant encirclement at any stage of its campaign. Skillfully utilizing terrain and ruthlessly exploiting the civilian population, the Soviets construct a fortified line along the Luga River that stalls the Germans for a month until massive Luftwaffe and motorized reinforcements from Army Group Center allow a decisive breakthrough and dash for Leningrad itself. In a furious September battle, the Germans fall just short of taking Leningrad when time runs out. Operation Typhoon, the final push against Moscow, is imminent. Army Group North must give up almost all of its Luftwaffe and motorized formations. With no strike force remaining, the Germans dig in.

        description: "June 1941 -- the German juggernaut rolls over the Soviet Army. As the tally of encirclements and surrenders mounts, the German advance appears unstoppable to Hitler and many others. However, the officers and men at the front are beginning to have serious misgivings -- not in themselves, but in the pre-war intelligence estimates that they had received. They had not been prepared to encounter hundreds of KV-1's and T-34's, tanks far superior to anything they possessed. For the moment, German tactics provided the margin of victory over better material, but the Russians were proving to be quick learners. Worse yet, by western European standards, Russian losses had been so staggering that there should have been no army left to fight. Not so. There seemed to be no end to these tenacious Russian defenders. As the German forces continued their eastward advance, more and more soldiers began asking, &quot;What have we gotten ourselves into?&quot;<br/><br/>Kiev, the first major German objective in the south, did not fall on schedule. In fact, Soviet resistance was so fierce that it required diverting Guderian's Panzer Group away from the advance on Moscow. Kiev fell in one of the greatest encirclements of the Second World War, but the German advance on Moscow was delayed for several critical weeks.

        description: 'GMT is proud to present Vance von Borries&rsquo; sixth epic game in his award winning series of East Front games, Barbarossa: Crimea. This is a two-player operational level game depicting the battles in the Crimean peninsula of the Soviet Union during 1941 and 1942. Beginning in mid-October 1941 and ending in January 1942, it completes the year 1941 in this series of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. And it includes 1942 scenarios of the continued fighting in Crimea until the historical fall of the great Soviet naval fortress Sevastopol in July 1942.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>One 22x34 inch map<br/>840 counters<br/>Rule booklet in color<br/>Playbook in color<br/>Various player aid cards for charts and tables in color<br/>Set up cards for each scenario in color<br/>4 Scenario cards 11x17<br/>1 ten sided die<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, waffen SS, NKVD, militia, base units, naval units, and more. You have reinforcement options to tailor your army to fight a full campaign with many historical variables.<br/><br/>As we have indicated with each game, all games in this series share the same game mechanics. Veteran East Front Series (EFS) players will find much here that is familiar. Such mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away, and for them we have clarified many game procedures. For those who are new to the series, examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.<br/><br/>All games of the EFS series are built to fit together side-by-side for possible combined play. We recognize that space is at a premium for some of you, so consider that all of the eight scenarios in this game require only one map or less; yes, just one map! Newcomers should try this game as a sample of the whole series.<br/><br/>Barbarossa: Crimea includes several special features not found with all EFS games. Since the game revolves around Sevastopol, we include a special inset map to depict in detail the fighting at that important naval fortress. Much gaming will directly involve the inset, so we have streamlined previous series rules dealing with an inset map. We have also streamlined the naval rules, effectively rebuilding them. This in turn allowed us to rebuild the Odessa scenario found with the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series. There, and later in Crimea, the Soviets used amphibious operations to move battle lines forward. If an amphibious operation is not going well, the Soviets could declare an Evacuation. At Sevastopol the German player will be using his super-heavy artillery, including the world&rsquo;s largest artillery piece, Dora, historically seen in the final game scenario. The design notes include an essay on these wonder-weapons.<br/><br/>Barbarossa: Crimea challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?<br/><br/>THE SCENARIOS<br/><br/>1) Learning Scenario: The Tartar Ditch. The German 11th Army has just received orders to enter the Crimea but to do so it must first clear the narrow Perekop Isthmus. This was the first battle for the Crimea. This is a small scenario but it teaches important lessons in precise game unit positioning - exactly what one would expect for historical positional warfare.<br/><br/>2) Odessa: Hero City. This is a bloody example of siege warfare. The Romanian army shows exactly why it was so ill-suited for such an offensive, while the Soviets struggle to balance their forces from sector-to-sector and endure delays of reinforcements coming by sea. This rebuilds the scenario found in theArmy Group South game using new research and this game&rsquo;s improved naval rules.<br/><br/>3) Crimea: The Road to Sevastopol. This begins in mid October 1941. The Germans almost certainly will break through the main Soviet defense line, so the Soviet player has to know when to break away from the action and run back to fresh prepared positions, a tactic typical of game play in other series games. The German player also chooses secret victory conditions. He will either drive south to Sevastopol or southeast to Kerch, forcing the Soviet to balance his defense of both.<br/><br/>4) Sevastopol: The First Battle. With the Germans committed to Sevastopol, can the Soviet divert enough German attention elsewhere to save the fortress? In the meantime, the deeper the German pushes into the Sevastopol inset map, the better his chances for long-term victory.<br/><br/>5) Crimean Campaign. The campaign scenario puts scenarios 3 and 4 together to feature a punch and counter-punch game strategy. The Soviet player relies on his naval units to rapidly shift the threat. The German relies on his infantry to consolidate gains.<br/><br/>6) Kerch: The Party Boss Attack. Ever wonder why Mandated Attacks exist in this game system? In the middle of winter 1942 one of Stalin&rsquo;s cronies thought the armies holding the Kerch Peninsula in the Crimea were not sufficiently motivated to defeat the fascists. He personally bullied the local Front commander into do-or-die attacks. This scenario exemplifies the insanity of political expectations trumping battlefield realities. Can you find a weakness in the Axis line?<br/><br/>7) Kerch: Operation Trappenjagd. Now it is the German turn to attack in the Kerch Peninsula but their champion knows how to attack. This is a brilliantly planned German attack, one that pays handsome dividends. Can you repeat Manstein&rsquo;s success? As the Soviet can you defeat Manstein&rsquo;s attack?<br/><br/>8) Sevastopol: Operation Storfang. This is the last picture show in the Crimea and it will be bloody. Truly, the best is saved for the last as the Soviets fight for every last hill, fort, and farmhouse. They went down fighting and their sacrifice earned them great honor in the history books. It was close. The German plan of offensive was sound and it met each challenge the Soviets posed. Can you duplicate Manstein&rsquo;s cold calculations and earn your marshal&rsquo;s baton?<br/><br/>',

Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?<br/><br/>THE SCENARIOS<br/><br/><br/>     Learning Scenario: Rostov Redeemed. The German 3rd Motorized Corps has just taken Rostov and now attempts to hold it against a massive Soviet counteroffensive. This was the first in what turned out to be a series of disasters that befell the German army during the winter of 1941/42.<br/>     Kiev Pocket. In mid-August the Germans had just cleared the Uman Pocket (the last battle of the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series) and looked to exploit their advantage to quickly conquer the rest of the Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Soviets had built a whole new group of armies to the east of the Dnepr River. This campaign resulted in the greatest encirclement battle of the war, perhaps of all time, as the Soviets over-committed to the defense of the river. Yet this was not a sure victory. Play testers have called this scenario the best yet in the entire series of games. You simply must experience this battle, one of the decisive battles of the war in the east.<br/>     Battle on the Sea of Azov. In late September with disaster looming to the north and a German offensive building against the Crimea, the relatively untouched Soviet 9 and 18 Armies in the southern portion of the Dnepr Bend were called upon to act, this time to save their comrades defending the Crimea by striking toward the rear of the German 11th Army. While their attack made but small headway, some Romanian defenders were overwhelmed. The situation could have opened up to destroy the German rear and then threaten the rear of the rest of German Army Group South. Perhaps this offensive could as well reverse the tide of the German advance. Or was someone in the Kremlin just dreaming?<br/>     Battle of Sumy. Some small battles lend themselves wonderfully to focus treatment and this battle at the end of September near the north Ukrainian town of Sumy certainly qualifies. Handled on its own special map this becomes a contest of mobility between a German motorized corps on the one hand and a strong Soviet cavalry corps on the other, with the Soviets getting timely reinforcements from the 1 Guards Motorized Rifle Division. This very balanced situation plays quickly and perhaps is the best introduction in the series to the game system.<br/>     To Kharkov. It has become almost trite to say Russia is vast but for this scenario the German player will declare this many times. Even though the German has just won the Kiev Pocket Battle, now the great industrial city of Kharkov beckons in the distant east. The Soviets have reassembled their armed forces yet again but this time the German has sent his panzers north to Moscow and out of this game (see GMT's Typhoon! Game). German 6th Army, a true hard-luck formation, gets the honor of leading the advance and they now experience their first starvation of the war, similar to that they will suffer at Stalingrad a year later, although without the desperation of that later battle. Even so, the 6th Army is formidable; so will the arrival of mud be the only thing saving the Soviet's behind? Or, will he have finally mastered the art of war against the Nazis?<br/>     To Rostov. The most dramatic moment of the late drive to the east was the drive to Rostov, the gateway to the Caucasus where lay the oilfields the Germans so vitally needed to run their war machine. The Germans have won victory after victory for nearly six months even though the Soviets have set successive armies in their path. Is this perhaps the Soviet last ditch and their last army? Are the Germans truly at the end of their supply line? Will winter stop the Germans? Historically in this near even contest, the panzers actually got into the streets of Rostov; can you?<br/>     Kiev to Rostov. This is the full campaign, mid-August through December, a very full 57 turns over vast distances. The Germans begin in supply difficulty and will have to pick a pause to advance their main bases. The Soviet player will have to take care he does not expend all his effort too far to the west, thereby leaving nothing for the final battles. Neither player has resources to do it all but it can be fun trying. The East Front experience is not complete without playing this full-size scenario. <br/><br/><br/>",

        description: "Bastogne: Screaming Eagles Under Siege,18-27 Dec '44,  is the thirteenth game is the Standard Combat Series.  This game covers the defense of the little crossroads town of Bastogne from 18 December to 26 December 1944. It is not a game about the whole Ardennes Offensive, but rather a close-up look at the actual perimeter battle to protect the town and the mechanized delaying actions leading into it. The map only extends as far east as Longvilly and north to Noville at 400m per hex. Each turn is a day, units are generally companies.<br/><br/>Bastogne comes with special rules for road marching, Team SNAFU, barrages, and air strikes - but is built around a quick-to-play, simple-to-learn framework. Bastogne has three scenarios: an introductory scenario covering the Battle for Noville, a medium-sized one covering the Battle for Longvilly, and the withdrawal of Team Cherry plus the counterattack by the 501st Airborne Regiment, and the campaign game itself covering the whole action in a jam-packed 10 turns. A number of variants have been provided so you can experience the game over and over looking at fresh insights.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: One day<br/>Hex: 400 meters<br/>Units: Platoon to Battalion<br/><br/>Players: 2 (suitable for solitaire play)<br/>Playing Time: 4+ hours<br/>Complexity: Low<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/><br/>",

        description: 'Battle for China is a board game simulation of the War of Resistance against Japan from the initial Japanese invasion in July 1937 to the end of 1941. The game is designed for two players, one directing the military forces acting to defend China against the Japanese invaders (the Chinese Player) and the other the forces of Imperial Japan (the Japanese Player). The game can also be played with a third player taking the Chinese Communist forces.<br/><br/>Game comes with a map depicting China, 150 miles to an inch. It is divided into multiple areas, with one or more areas corresponding appproximately to a province. Units are abstract, each representing approximate Corps and Armies for the Chinese and Divisions and Brigades for the Japanese.<br/><br/>The Japanese translation of the game came out in Command Magazine Japan #42. It features die-cut counters, an enlarged map, and integrates the More Battle for China expansion kit (more rules, two extra half-maps and more counters to game out the rest of World War Two (1942-45) and the Civil War (1947-49)).<br/><br/>June 2009: Fiery Dragon productions has come out with &quot;Battle for China Deluxe&quot;, a special edition of the game that includes the expansion kit More Battle for China. The package includes:<br/><br/>- 44-page integrated rulebook for all three games, with coil binding<br/>- two red dice<br/>- 12 cards for the various charts and tables for the three games<br/>- 5 sheets of counters, for a total of 480 counters - consisting of the three sheets for the original game, and two new ones for the expansion. Counters might still be a bit thin for some tastes (but then they would not fit in the box) but the diecutting is good.<br/>- 3 maps, the original 11x17&quot; central map plus the north and south 8x11&quot; extensions (Siberia-Manchuria and Siam-Burma-India, respectively). The North map matches up well and obviously. For the South map the area north of Burma-1 is Burma-3, and the area north of Burma-2 is Burma-4. The unnamed area north of India-8 is Nepal and is impassable.<br/><br/>This was the last version of Battle for China to appear before the Decision Games edition of the basic 1937-41 game in late 2009. Production of the deluxe version is limited, fewer than 125 copies I believe.<br/><br/>When the Decision Games edition appears, the designer will post an updated and integrated set of rules and charts for the expansion kit, along with homemade redrawn extension maps to fit the larger 22x34&quot; map. The counter sheets provided do not need to be changed, but be advised that the counters in the Decision Games edition have been changed to iconic style, with a different format.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Battle for China, 1937-1941 (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/>',

        description: "Battle for Germany game is small, it only takes about three to four hours to play for players of normal skill and luck. The game starts in December of 1944 with the Ardennes Offensive (a variant allows the German player to skip this and save his strength). As a two-player game, it is interesting in that each player plays both an Allied army (Western Allies or Soviet Union) AND a German army (Western Front or Eastern Front). This forces each player to play offense and defense. The player playing the Western Allies and Eastern Germans has a very challenging task. The Western Germans have good defensive terrain (the Rhine river and Westwall defenses), while the Eastern Germans have weak units, a long front, very poor defensive terrain and they face a large Soviet and Yugoslav army. The only real advantage enjoyed by the East German player is the lack of victory points to be gained in the East, and the slow Soviet replacement rate. The Western Alllied units are very fast moving, but they don't usually get a chance to exploit this until the very end of the game (at best).<br/><br/>The map is the same size as most SPI Quadrigames or folio games and has similar graphics. Cities are rated as 1 or 2 victory points, with Berlin worth 10. A line down the middle of Germany cannot be crossed (in the 2-player game), which makes Berlin the only city which can be captured by the Western Allies or the Soviets (ahistorical, but essential to the game's concept). Units are corps for the Germans and Western Allies and corps, armies, or fronts for the Soviet player. Each unit is rated for attack, defense and movement. Combat is decided by an odds-based combat results table and a die roll. Combat results include various combinations of retreat and elimination (there are no step losses, disruption or anything like this). Eliminated units can be replaced, but very slowly and (for some players) with the weakest available unit coming back first.<br/><br/>The game includes variants for 3- and 4-player versions where the Germans are played by 1 or 2 players, and a &quot;red star/ white star&quot; scenario where the Western Allies and Soviets fight it out with some help from the remnants of the German army.<br/><br/>Originally published in S&amp;T 50 - May/Jun 1975<br/><br/>",

Codenamed Operation Typhoon, German tanks and infantry pressed relentlessly forward until they could see the very spires of the Kremlin.

Numerous scenarios are included to play out various smaller battles in Normandy. It is intended for two players or player teams.<br/><br/>The game uses a unique sequence of play and a system of fire combat throughout the airdrop and beach assault phases with company-level breakdown units, then a more traditional odds-type combat approach throughout the rest of the game. Initial beach defense deployments at start and daily air support and defense allocations, hidden to the opposing player; create a level of uncertainty that makes for a tense, challenging duel.<br/><br/>The game combines a detailed, extensively researched order of battle with relatively fast-playing game mechanics to make it not only the largest representation of the Normandy campaign available to date, but a manageable one that is meant to be played, not shelved. Scenarios include &lsquo;Bloody Omaha&rsquo;, &lsquo;Operation Epsom&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cobra&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Fight for Cherbourg&rsquo; and more.<br/><br/>A future expansion will extend the play area south, to include the Mortain and Falaise scenarios, and extend the campaign to late August and the 3rd Army breakout.<br/><br/>Game Equipment: <br/><br/>     One Rule Book <br/>     One Scenario Book <br/>     Five (5) 22x34&rdquo; full color Maps <br/>     Nine (9) full color counter sheets <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Allied Air Allocation Log (laminated) <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Axis AAA Allocation Log (laminated) <br/>     11x17&rdquo; Turn Record Track <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Terrain Effects Chart (x2) <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Repl/Recon/Weather chart (x2) <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; German Record Track <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Allied Record Track <br/>     8.5x11&rdquo; Combat Results Table (x2) <br/>     Dice - 3d6 and 1d10<br/><br/><br/>(from the GMT Website)<br/><br/>',

The conflict raged for seven weeks in late 1942. Elements of fourteen German divisions of the Sixth Army and Fourth Panzer Army engaged dozens of divisions and brigades of the Soviet 62nd Army in one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war.<br/><br/>Battle for Stalingrad uses a game-system of German action and Soviet reaction, highlighting the differences in command and tactics employed by the Germans and Soviets at the time. The Ger-mans enjoyed superior application of their air power and artillery. Their efficient communications and command structure, under General Friedrich von Paulus, allowed them to maintain complete initiative in the battle until they were well into the built-up areas of Stalingrad itself. The Soviets, on the other hand, had poor communications among their forces. Lieutenant-General Vasili Chuikov was hard pressed to maintain com-mand of his army, even in the most critical areas of the city. The campaign was finally decided among the burnt out blocks of the dying metropolis, where the Soviets proved themselves masters of urban combat and the German drive to the East was halted.<br/><br/>1980 SPI Version Components;<br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: 656 yards / 600 meters<br/>Units: Company to Regiment<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheet (One sheet with 400 1/2&quot; counters and one sheet with 200 1/2&quot; counters))<br/>One 32-page rulebook<br/>One 22.25 x 29&quot; Player Aid Sheet (Setup &amp; Reinforcements)<br/>Two 6 sided Dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>2011 Excalibre Version;<br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: 656 yards / 600 meters<br/>Units: Company to Regiment<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheet (two sheets with 280 1/2&quot; counters and one sheet with 40 1/2&quot; counters))<br/>One 54-page rulebook<br/>One 32-page rules supplement &amp; game analysis booklet<br/>One 17 x 20&quot; Deployment Display Chart<br/>One 14 x 22&quot; Reinforcement Display Chart<br/>Two 6 sided Dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>',

A relief column was sent out from Carlisle in order to try and break the siege. The column was under the command of Colonel Henry Bouquet and consisted of approximately 500 British soldiers of the 42nd Highlanders, 77th Highlanders, and 60th Royal Americans.<br/><br/>On August 5th, several hundred Indian warriors of the Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, and Huron tribes attacked the column east of Bushy Run Station. The British held out, and that night a redoubt was constructed from the supplies, and the wounded were treated inside this perimeter. The next day, the Indians attacked again, and a British counterattack broke the Indians. The British column was able to advance, and relieve Fort Pitt on August 10th.<br/><br/>The Battle of Bushy Run game uses a simplified version of Iwo Jima: Rage Against the Marines (in Operations Special Magazine Issue #1). The American Indian units use a concealed map and have dummy units to help hide their movement. The British force is a mix of soldiers, grenadiers, and scouts (who can reveal hidden Indian units). To increase replayability there are random events each turn (8 turns, 10 event chits, so 2 are not played each game...their identify is not revealed). Both sides have multiple ways in which they can secure victory.<br/><br/>',

Each side has 22 pieces (10 infantry, 10 cavalry and 2 artillery), and the starting positions are fixed.  The grid is square, with no diagonal movement allowed.  On your turn, you roll two dice for movement, resulting in between 2 and 12 movement points to allocate.  Infantry moves 1 per pip, cavalry and artillery 2 per pip (a one-square move still consumes 1 pip).  Mountains force pieces to pause (they must stop until the next turn).  Railroads link stations and can be used to accelerate movement (one station per pip).<br/><br/>Combat is handled by lining pieces up (horizontally or vertically) to face (or flank) an enemy column.  You must have battle strength superiority to resolve the battle, and this is done after movement is concluded.  Infantry and artillery have combat strength 2, cavalry has combat strength 1.  The rear piece then jumps to the other end of the combined columns, and the entire enemy army is removed.  To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are &quot;safe&quot; --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.<br/><br/>You win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.  The four player game splits command of each army in two, and is played in partnerships.<br/><br/>A really good game, combining a historical theme with rather abstract mechanics.<br/><br/>',

        description: '(From the Publisher)<br/>The Battlelines&trade; series of card games allow players to recreate the epic struggles of World War II. Each player uses a deck of cards to represent the troops of an historical formation about the size of a division. A third deck, the Operation deck, is used to create a series of battles using Mission and Location cards. Points are scored for achieving Mission objectives and destroying enemy troops. A typical 100 point Operation can be played in about an hour.  The game can also be played by teams of up to three players on each side.<br/><br/>This, the first  in the Battlelines&trade; Series World War II card games. It includes Units and Operations from the German 1942 offensive against Stalingrad, the Soviet counter-attack (Operation Uranus) which trapped the German 6th Army in the city, and the gallant efforts of 4th Panzer Army to relieve their surrounded comrades (Operation Winter Storm).<br/><br/>Unit Decks represent divisional level assets. They are the basic play decks. One is needed for each player. Operation Decks are used to generate a &quot;random&quot; series of &quot;scenarios&quot; depicting several days of fighting. Higher Echelon Decks will allow players to introduce new cards into their Unit Decks to liven up the game and surprise their opponents with new stratagems.<br/><br/>The decks are not &quot;collectible&quot; per se.  There are no &quot;rare&quot; cards to collect.  They can however be customized by mixing in units from &quot;higher echelon&quot; decks that are available.  The game is considered &quot;expandable&quot; since there are many different decks (sold individually) that can be played against each other.<br/><br/>',

The bay, rises, 2 streams as well as the Persian camp are clearly shown, although the Persian camp hexes sit pretty on the map but appear to have no effect on the game at all - no vps for the Greeks passing through or occupying the hexes at all.<br/><br/>The functional counters show Persian footmen, cav and bowmen along with the Greek hoplites.<br/><br/>Standard rules are used with specific scenario rules being the Greek charge in turn one which triples their movement, thus all hoplite units are able to crash into the Persian ranks on turn one, if the Greek player feels the urge - and it is advisable, as another rule states, that the disorganized Persian cavalry cannot move and would defend at half strength up until turn 4.  Thus the Greek is encouraged to batter through some of the Persian foot and close with the cav before turn 4 if possible.<br/><br/>All in all, a fine simulation given the scope of the system rules. The Persians' only good chance is to resist the Greek hoplites with foot until turn 4 and then try and turn any Greek flank possible, by moving their cavalry away and around the Greeks and charging them in clear terrain - if the Greeks allow themselves to be exploited this way, of course.<br/><br/>",

Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.<br/><br/>After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?<br/><br/>Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don\'t match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.<br/><br/>Official Site, Rules &amp; FAQ: <a target=\'_blank\' href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&amp" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm...</a>;esem=4<br/>Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: <a target=\'_blank\' href="http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ</a><br/><br/>',

        description: 'Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe, September 1944 - April 1945, begins with the German Army reeling from a string of near-fatal defeats, and in full retreat to the safety of the West Wall where it hopes to make a stand. The Allies, flush with victory, believe one more push will bring them home for Christmas.<br/><br/>The expected walk-over was not to be, and players will find either army a challenge to command. Allied material superiority is (mostly) balanced by German tenacity, rugged terrain, and lousy weather. Defensive-minded players will be happiest playing the Germans, but players of all temperaments will discover that there is still plenty of torque left in the Axis even at this late stage of the war. The Allies will not cross the Rhine without a tough fight!<br/><br/>Beyond the Rhine is a big game, with 3.5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. At this scale the various Western Front battles&mdash;Market-Garden, H&uuml;rtgen, Bulge, Nordwind, Remagen, etc.&mdash;have an operational ebb and flow, but can also be viewed in relation to the whole front. A comprehensive game like this one, covering the entire Western Front, was long overdue.<br/><br/>Special rules in this 14th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this fascinating campaign. They include:<br/><br/>Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning DAK. These cover things like Fuel Shortages, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, Lost Couriers, Railway Strikes, and Dambuster Raids. The 58 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.<br/>The importance and difficulty of the Rhine crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and pontoons to be emplaced.<br/>Background effects of Allied air interdiction are simple and elegant (built into the Terrain Effects Chart and Weather), but the player does have the option to switch some of these planes to normal barrages and sweeps.<br/>The strategic significance of the Ruhr and the Saar, of clearing the left bank of the Rhine, and of major ports such as Antwerp are reflected by simple economic effects and the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Broadfront&rdquo; restrictions on US supply placement and usage.<br/>The Wacht am Rhein counter-offensive is recreated by simple mechanics for off-map buildup and operational surprise.<br/>Many options are included for players wanting even more realism. For instance, there are rules for German Kampfgruppen and extra restrictions on the plethora of Allied independent units.<br/>Beyond the Rhine features three monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,000 combat units.

        description: "The Big Push covers the gigantic battle of the Somme in summer-fall of 1916. Rivaling Verdun in ferocity, scale and casualties, Somme was Britain's first real chance to open up the Western Front in World War I. French and British allies, wanting to take initiative away from Germany at Verdun, launched a large joint offensive at the Somme, where their fronts met. British generals called it the &quot;Big Push,&quot; to break the trenches and carry them to victory. Here was a campaign that brought little save the cultural annihilation of the participants. Europe never looked at war quite the same way after the Somme.<br/><br/>The British player controls the Allied forces (British and French), while the other player commands the defending German Army. It is also possible to have three players--French, British, and German. Each Game Turn represents one week. Map scale measures approximately 1142 yards per square (squares rather than hexes are used to prevent the easy outflanking of enemy units - something very hard to do in WW1). Ground units range in size from regiments to divisions. Each infantry strength point varies between 700 and 1500 men, depending on nationality and fighting effectiveness. Support units, like artillery, cavalry and tanks, focus their strength more on relative fire power and attack force. Play begins with artillery fire, where the other player may throw in his counter battery fire to offset the barrages. Ground movement comes next, followed by the declaration of assaults, appeals to command center resources, and defensive fire. After assaults take place, the phasing player introduces replacements and tries to rally his disordered units.<br/><br/>",

        description: 'Bitter End: Attack to Budapest, 1945, is an operational-level simulation of the German attempts to relieve the encircled Hungarian capital of Budapest, besieged by Soviet forces, in January 1945.<br/><br/>Budapest, Hungary, January 1945<br/><br/>79,000 Axis troops belonging to the IX SS Mountain and 1st Hungarian Corps are surrounded and being pounded by two Soviet armies, the 46th and 7th Guards. The situation is grim. The Soviets are well- supported by heavy artillery and the German line has been steadily retreating, leaving Budapest in grave danger.<br/><br/>On January 1st, the German IV SS and III Panzer Corps launch a surprise attack to rescue the defenders and recapture the city. By January 12th the attack is stalled in the rough terrain to the west of the city. Hitler shifts the focus of the attack from the west to the south-west and continues the attack on January 18th. Although progress is made, Soviet reinforcements pour into the area and the offensive grinds to a halt.<br/><br/>Hitler calls off the attack at the end of January, and by February 14th, after seven weeks of grueling combat, Budapest falls.<br/><br/><br/>By January of 1945 Nazi Germany_s military fate was sealed. There was nothing the German forces in Hungary could have achieved that could have substantially delayed or even mitigated this defeat. That did not deter the German attempt to relieve Budapest. Hitler_s goal in ordering the attack toward Budapest was not the rescue of its garrison, but rather the recapture and retention of the city. The garrison was in fact ordered not to break out but instead to hold and await relief. Few commanders on the German side took the idea of the retention of Budapest seriously, however. Had the relieving German forces gotten to within a few miles of the city, a breakout attempt would probably have been made. Bitter End lets the players explore the tantalizing possibilities. In addition, players may test their skills with several viable historical alternatives, such as the inclusion of forces that could have been available to the respective commanders.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (456 9/16&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Bitter End rulebook<br/>Two dual-side printed Unit Organizational Charts<br/>Two dual-side printed Historical Set-up Charts<br/>Three dual-side printed Player Aid Cards<br/>One 6-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-25 hours<br/><br/>',

Each turn represents 12 hours of real time.<br/><br/>Game features include morale, prominent leaders, blitzkrieg tactics, German army boundaries, initial surprise, Allied air power and much more.<br/><br/>This is the Deluxe Edition, an entirely new version (fourth edition) of the game.<br/><br/>First off, they've mounted the game-mapboard-(30&quot; by 46&quot;) to avoid the problems with paper mapsheets(which also increases the cost of doing such). They have improved &amp; updated the graphics for everything all around, and increased the size of the game counters to 5/8&quot;, while that's been factored into the cost as well. Then, they greatly enhanced the current Rulesbook (4th edition) with new scenarios, an additional variant, rules changes &amp; clarifications, included a Players Handbook, updated the designer's notes, and much more! There are full COLOR player aid cards, Random Events are introduced, they've updated the cartography (the map graphics), provided an updated Order of Battle, the hexes have been enlarged to contain the larger game counters, and variant counters are also introduced.<br/><br/>For those of you with distinguishing tastes in their choice of wargames, this has also been acclaimed by the noted designer and expert on the subject, Danny S. Parker. You'll have to go to the l2designgroup.com website to see this as words can't do it justice.

        description: "The Blitzkrieg Legend simulates Case Yellow, the German offensive in May of 1940 that shocked the world. In less than a month's time it made quick work of Belgium and Holland, shattered the armies of France, and pushed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into the sea at Dunkirk. This twelfth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) game from Multi-Man Publishing and departs from its established norms in using a ground scale of 3 miles per hex and a time scale of two-day turns, and as such is similar to Sicily. The chosen scale lets this lightning campaign unfold a bit more slowly, and gives the densely-packed armies more room to maneuver.<br/><br/>Case Yellow achieved the largest pocket ever to be created in the war, with the largest number of captured soldiers as well. This result is sometimes looked upon by gamers and historians alike as a foregone conclusion, but Manstein's daring strike through the Ardennes was a gamble that might easily have gone awry. Hindsight suggests the fighting could have gone much differently.<br/><br/>A range of historical problems confront the player directing the Allies in this game. His French, Belgian, Dutch, and BEF combat units have not yet mastered the faster pace of action in WWII, and therefore are slow and don't fight at full Action Rating when in Move Mode. The Allies are also forced to adopt the historical Dyle Plan (when not playing the what-if version of the campaign), which leaves the French with inadequate reserves behind the Ardennes and too many of their best forces committed to shielding Antwerp and Brussels. Because history tells us the headlong rush into Belgium was primary cause of the quick Allied defeat, an &quot;If I Was in Charge...&quot; version of the campaign is presented to allow both sides to explore some different initial deployments.<br/><br/>A simple set of campaign objectives are presented, with Victory Point awards centered on the following:<br/><br/>&bull; The French must vigilantly protect Paris, which is the ultimate German objective. Two more cities along the map's south edge, Verdun and Metz, are also worth points (so the French cannot just abandon the Maginot Line).<br/><br/>&bull; The possible surrender of Holland is triggered by German armor moving adjacent to any of the three Dutch major cities. Surrender chances are modified if the French and BEF are supporting Holland (which is why French 7th Army initially moved north of Antwerp).<br/><br/>&bull; The possible surrender of Belgium and BEF Evacuation are triggered when the Germans drive a wedge between the Belgian coast and Paris. Surrender chances are modified, however, if the French and BEF are supporting Belgium (another nod toward the historical rationale of the Dyle Plan).<br/><br/>&bull; The Germans also win points for battering the BEF, so the Allies are encouraged to keep this force intact.<br/><br/>The game's special rules are judiciously chosen to evoke the full flavor of the campaign. For instance, the Maginot Line is given its historical due, shown as a strong right shield that can unfortunately be outflanked through the Ardennes. Rules for special operations are something new to OCS, and these can capture enemy bridges and forts (but just on 10 May unless playing an optional rule). As mentioned above, the BEF can get isolated or mauled as part of the victory conditions, and if this happens a ragtag assemblage rides to the rescue: RN Destroyers, special Evacuation Ports, elite Irish and Welsh battalions, and even some Spitfires finally appear to provide some top-cover. Mix in the occasional Pause &mdash; an event that tugs sharply on the panzers' leash &mdash; and you've the kind of chrome that make The Blitzkrieg Legend a tremendous tool for historical study and an exciting source of gaming  pleasure.<br/><br/>The Blitzkrieg Legend is also a game with tremendous replay value. Presented are 7 scenarios and 3 campaigns. The longest is just 13 turns; the largest fits on a standard 4' x 6' table.  Series veterans know the depth of the model can lead to some long and complex turns, but here at last we have an entire campaign that can easily be played to the finish!<br/><br/>Scenarios<br/><br/>1. South.  The first 4 turns on the southern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Sedan as well as the crossings of the Meuse further downstream by 6th and 8th Panzer.<br/>   2. Center. The first 4 turns on the northern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Gembloux Gap as well as the crossings of the Meuse by 5th and 7th Panzer.<br/>   3. North. The first 4 turns on Map C. Covers the air landings and surrender of Holland.<br/>   4. Mini-Campaign. Links the first three scenarios into a short campaign using two maps.<br/>   5. Sedan. Lasts just 2 turns and uses just a small portion of Map B. Covers the French counterattack and German breakout.<br/>   6. Arras. Lasts just 1 player turn. A teaching scenario covering the Allied counterattack.<br/>   7. Dynamo. Lasts 8 turns. Plays like a campaign game, using just Map A to cover the important events during the last half of the campaign.<br/><br/>Campaigns<br/><br/>1. &quot;No Holland&quot; Version. Doesn't include the fighting in Holland, which is &quot;automatic&quot; and not under player control. Uses two maps, the full 13 turns.<br/>   2. &quot;With Holland&quot; Version. Uses all three maps, the full 13 turns.<br/>   3. &quot;If I Was in Charge...&quot;  Several variations on either of the two campaigns are offered.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/><br/>     OCS Series Rulebook<br/>     TBL Game Specific Rulebook<br/>     Two Charts and Tables Booklets<br/>     Full Color Game Map (two 22x34, one 28x15)<br/>     1,960 Counters (7 counter sheets)<br/>     One 8.5x11 Play Aid<br/>     10 Scenarios (3 of them are Campaign Scenarios)<br/>     Box and Dice<br/><br/><br/>",

        description: "Borodino: Doomed Victory, The Battle for Moscow, 1812, is a simulation of the The Battle of Borodino fought on 7 September 1812 in the Napoleonic Wars during the French invasion of Russia.<br/><br/>The fighting involved around 250,000 troops and left at least 70,000 casualties, making Borodino the deadliest day of the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon's Grande Arm&eacute;e launched an attack against the Russian army, driving it back from its initial positions but failing to gain a decisive victory. Both armies were exhausted after the battle and the Russians withdrew from the field the following day. Borodino represented the last Russian effort at stopping the French advance on Moscow, which fell a week later. However, the French had no clear way of forcing Czar Alexander to capitulate because the Russian army was not decisively defeated, resulting in the ultimate defeat of the French invasion following the retreat from Moscow in October.<br/><br/>Two scenarios are provided: a historical scenario (where units are placed as they were actually deployed) and a hypothetical scenario (where players are free to deploy where they wish).<br/><br/>Victory is solely based on Russian strength losses, the French player must eliminate at least 90 strength points to win.

This game was recently published in the new Panzerschreck issue #14. This is a 9 turn game on a small map with 10 units per side. Should play quickly. The game has initiative, disruption, counterattacks, event chits (which modify a rule or condition). Victory is determined by comparing (at the end of the game) the randomly drawn Victory Chit (by the Union player) with the status at the end of the game. The Confederate player does not know what goal the Union player has. The CRT is relatively bloodless, but you accumulate Disruption Markers which represent losses and reduced combat/maneuver abilities (sort of a step loss system).<br/><br/>",

        description: "An early morning fog burned off with the dawn, and revealed two long columns of scarlet and blue clad troops. This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.<br/><br/>General George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.<br/><br/>Thus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end. One bold stroke will free the land.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        description: "Brazen Chariots  is a Series: Battalion Combat Series (MMP) game that chronicles fighting in the North African desert towards the end of 1941. Once Axis forces under Rommel had laid siege to Tobruk, they then set about trying to take it. Meanwhile, Commonwealth forces pushed back to the Egyptian border launched several attempts to break into and relieve the fortress. Two of these efforts, BREVITY and BATTLEAXE, lacked the depth needed to accomplish this goal and were utter failures. The third, CRUSADER, was a massive undertaking that successfully opened communications to Tobruk and proved to the British 8th Army that Rommel could be beaten. It also set the stage for Rommel's Gazala offensive in 1942.<br/><br/>Brazen Chariots is the third game in the Battalion Combat Series, which took players by storm with its blockbuster initial release Last Blitzkrieg: Wacht am Rhein, The Battle of the Bulge and follow-up fast playing game Baptism By Fire: The Battle of Kasserine. In Brazen Chariots, the wide-open desert, the limited number of Formations, and numerous shorter scenarios provide players with both a rapid and fun introduction to this highly acclaimed new series.

A combined-arms assault, plus the use of new artillery techniques, initially smashed the German trench line.  In several places, the attackers suffered almost no casualties and, by the end of the day, recorded gains of three to four miles. Would it be possible, this time, to break through to the &ldquo;green fields beyond&rdquo;?

        description: "&quot;Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War&quot; is a tactical combat wargame of the first battle of Bull Run.<br/><br/>The game is played on a map of the area over which the battle was fought overlaid with a hexagonal grid. Units are infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with brigade, division, and army leaders. Each turn is 30 minutes, and each hex represents 1000 ft. Units are basically regiments and batteries. Some infantry regiments with their brigade leader are capable of forming brigades, increasing offensive power at the expense of movement. Batteries can be limbered for increased movement at the expense of firepower, or unlimbered with full firepower and limited movement.<br/><br/>Combat is a modified version of the classic system adopted by the earlier Avalon Hill games.  However, rules for leader command activation, infantry screening of artillery, and infantry forming brigades to prevent soak-off attacks, ranged artillery, rally of losses are give the game a unique flavour.<br/><br/>The major terrain obstacle is Bull Run which provides the Confederate with defensive advantages and hinders Union movement. <br/> The game begins with the Union troops approaching partially hidden, unsuspecting Confederate forces.  As the Union attack develops, additional Confederate leaders and combat units are activated and are rushed to stem the Union advance.  The Union player wins if he is able to capture any of three objective hexes by the end of the game or takes Manassas at any time.  The Confederate player wins if he takes Centreville at any time or prevents the Union player from holding any of objective hexes at the game end.<br/><br/>The game consists of a 32&quot; by 22&quot; mapboard, 260 counters, various charts, a 12 page rulebook and 1 die.<br/><br/><br/>Magazine References:<br/><br/>The GENERAL Index  Article List:<br/><br/><br/>    The GENERAL Vol.20,No.5<br/>        Series Replay - Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War, Rex A.

        description: "Burma - The Campaign for Northern Burma, March-August, 1944, is the sixth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) from The Gamers, and covers covers the 1944 campaigns beginning with the Japanese &quot;U-Go&quot; offensive and ending up as what would be know as Imphal-Kohima, the most dramatic defeat ever inflicted on a Japanese army.<br/><br/>In the spring of 1944, two equally matched opponents faced each other in the jungles and mountains of Northern Burma. During that spring and summer, three independent, but simultaneous, dramas unfolded. In the west, the Japanese launched an all-out offensive to capture Imphal. In the center, the Chindits landed in the Japanese rear area. In the east, the Chinese/US forces moved toward Myitkyina against stubborn Japanese defenses. These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world&rsquo;s best to the world&rsquo;s worst.<br/><br/>Burma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend.<br/><br/>While mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the &quot;cool stuff&quot; too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply, elephant and oxen transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army. Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it's conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules.<br/><br/>Unlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs).<br/><br/>Scenario Info:<br/><br/>    Learning Scenario: 1/8th of Map B; 5 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 1 - Operation Thursday: 1/4 of Map B; 9 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 2 - U-Go: 3/4 map of Map B; 10 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 3 - Merril's Marauders: 3/4 map, but requires both maps to play; 24 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 4 - Sato's Dilemna: 1/2 map of Map A; 11 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 5 - Imphal: 1/2 map of Map A; 17 turns<br/>    Campaign Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (which use both maps, obviously); 45, 41, and 31 turns respectively<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1/2 week<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory (Burma II - printed 2008):<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 48-page OCS version v4.0 rules booklet<br/>One 40-page Burma II specific rules booklet<br/>Two 4-sided OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Players: 1 or more (also suitable for solitaire and team play)<br/>Playing Time: 1 to 60 hours<br/>Complexity: High<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Moderate<br/><br/>",

The British and Spanish monarchs did not reckon with the ambitions of Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and Emperor of the French. The wily Napoleon III schemed to conquer Mexico and set up a puppet regime that would bleed Mexico of its treasures to finance a resurgent French Empire.<br/><br/>Napoleon III picked an obscure Austrian archduke named Maximilian to be his cat&rsquo;s-paw and supported the effort with thousands of French troops. Even though there was some local support in Mexico for the return to a monarchy, most of the country remained loyal to the elected president, Benito Juarez and the French spent huge amounts of treasure and blood to try to put down the Republican Forces. From 1862 through 1866, Napoleon III and his puppet Maximilian attempted to forge a Mexican Empire, but after the United States won its Civil War, the threat of an invasion from the North and growing concerns about the ascendancy of the Prussian military in Europe forced Napoleon to withdraw his army from Mexico. The remaining troops loyal to Maximilian were not enough to stop the growing Republican army, and Maximilian was captured and executed in 1867.<br/><br/>Can you, as the French/Imperial Mexican player succeed where Napoleon III failed and pacify a hostile land? You have some of the finest units in the French army, including the famed Foreign Legion, volunteers from Austria, Belgium and Egypt, and a growing army of loyal Mexicans at your disposal. Or, as the Republican Player, can you outwit the powerful French army and restore Mexico to its rightful ruler, Benito Juarez?<br/><br/>Design - Andy Nunez<br/>Development - Paul Rohrbaugh<br/>Graphic Design - Craig Grando<br/><br/>',

Caesar and the Romans - the VI, XXVII, and XXXVII legions, lots of archers and auxiliaries, and a dangerous contingent of field artillery - control the center of the city, including the Palace and the Inner Harbor. The Egyptians - a mixture of heavy, medium, and light infantry, and a numerically superior galley fleet - control the Outer Harbor, the rest of the city, and all land approaches to it.<br/> The Romans must defend their city position and also take control of the Heptastadium, the bridge that connects the city to the island of Pharos and its lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World.<br/> Caesar in Alexandria combines GBoH with War Galley, with rules for both systems included. On land, the game is closer to Simple GBoH (which is not needed to play this), mostly because the form of warfare involved here: street-fighting. Caesar in Alexandria also uses the SGBoH command and activation system, which is what produces the large dose of tension. Do you move legions to protect your inner defense, or do you continue to attack the town of Pharos to gain access to the Heptastadium? Do you transport land troops to the island, or do you move your battle galleys out to sea, around Pharos, and into the Outer Harbor to attack the Egyptian fleet? Each turn you can do only one, all the while your opponent is considering his several, difficult options.<br/><br/>Included are some small scenarios for quicker play.<br/><br/>",

        description: "In 58 BC, Gaius Julius Caesar was appointed by the Roman Senate as proconsul for Gaul, for which he was given four legions. The ambitious Caesar, a military ingenue, had little idea of how lucky he was going to be -- as he was in usually everything he did -- because, within a short space of a few years, after coming to the rescue of the Gauls against incursions from Germanic tribes to the east, Caesar himself decided to bring the rest of the barbarian tribes under the domain of Republican Rome...and, at the same time, increase his visibility among the Roman people.<br/>From a military point of view it was an immense achievement, one that fueled Roman imperialist feelings like no other war. For the Gauls it meant subjugation. For the gamer, it means six battles of Pure Excitement.<br/><br/>Bibracte 58BC     <br/>Caesar is called on by the Aeudui to repel the Helvetii. Caesar corners the Helvetii near the Aeudui oppidum, Bibracte, and forces them to attack him. The Helvetii fall back, regroup and, as Caesar's legions march toward them, attack again. At this moment, contingents of the Boii and Tulingi tribes hit Caesar's right flank.<br/><br/>The Rhine 58BC     <br/>Having defeated the Helvetii, Caesar is now asked by the Gauls to do the same against the aggressive Germans. The German tribes are led by a very capable and wily chief, Ariovistus -- he outmaneuvers Caesar to cut his supply line, to which Caesar reacts by outbluffing the Germans so that their lines are now cut.<br/><br/>The Sabis 57BC     <br/>Having decided to pacify Gaul, Caesar realizes he will have to start in the north, with the Belgae, the most dangerous tribe. He marches against them, reaching the banks of the Sabis (today, the Sambre) River. Without warning the Nervii and their allies, the Viromandui and Atrebates, emerge from the woods in full barbarian fury.<br/><br/>Bay of Biscay 56BC     <br/>The sea-oriented Amorican tribes of NW Gaul proved most difficult. They could not be defeated on land, so had to be attacked at sea. For that purpose, Caesar had his men build an entire fleet of biremes from scratch in less than two months. The Roman fleet, under Admiral Decimus Junius Brutus faced a difficult foe.<br/><br/>Britannia 55BC     <br/>Late Summer, and Caesar decides to cross the Channel. A fleet of 80 warships and transports reach the shores of Britannia near modern Dover. But their cavalry has been dispersed by a storm, and the Romans have a difficult time beaching their galleys. The Romans are beset by large numbers of Britons.<br/><br/>Lutetia 52BC     <br/>There are rumblings of a Gallic uprising, and Caesar sends his right-hand-man Titus Labienus, with four legions, against the local tribes around what is now Paris (Lutetia). After some up and down river maneuvering by both armies, the Gauls attack Labienus in a classic set-piece battle that serves as a learning scenario.<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/><br/>        Eight of Rome's most vaunted legions, including Caesar's favorite, the Xth, and its maximum-rated 1st cohort...each with its own artillery, auxiliares and hired cavalry.<br/>        Ten tribes of sword-armed, axe-throwing barbarian infantry, fueled by special rules for Barbarian Impetuosity and Ferocity.<br/>        For the first time in the GBoH system, war galleys, sail ships and transports...all in a preview of the Naval Warfare system for the series.<br/>        A much simplified command system (as opposed to the hierarchical system in Julius Caesar: The Civil Wars), reflecting the smaller Roman armies as well as the leadership theories of the tribes.<br/>        All three major land battles of the war, a full-scale invasion scenario as well as a smaller battle perfect for getting a feel for the game.<br/>        Special rules for Hit and Run tactics, as well as revised artillery use mechanics.<br/>        The *feared German cavalry...a combination of light horse and light infantry so effective that even the disciplined Romans sought to avoid confrontation.<br/>        A system that is perfect for solitaire play.<br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     20 minutes per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     75 yards per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:     100-150 men per size point<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four<br/><br/>(source: GMT website)<br/><br/><br/>Expansion Modules:<br/><br/>     Caratacus: two battles from the Claudian invasion of Britannia<br/>     Gergovia: Caesar's defeat in 52 BCE<br/>     Battles of the Warrior Queen: Covers the major engagements during the rebellion of the Iceni tribe and Boudicca&rsquo;s allies against the legions of Emperor Nero.

The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.<br/><br/>A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.<br/><br/>',

        description: 'Canadian Crucible:  Brigade Fortress at Norrey, is the sixteenth entry in the Multi-Man Publishing Tactical Combat Series (TCS) depicting the Canadian defense of Norrey on D-Day +2 (June 8) against a counterattack spearheaded by Grenadiers of the 12th SS Panzer Division.<br/><br/>One map, 560 counters, 10 scenarios including 2 campaigns. TCS 4.0 rules.<br/><br/>The battle depicted here begins on D-Day +2, June 8th, and continues for the next 3 days and was known by the Germans as the First Battle for Caen. The situation unfolds with the 7th Brigade of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division dug-in on its D-Day objectives. Aware of the resounding defeat that the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered the previous day at the hands of the Hitler Youth, the 7th prepares a Fortress around Bretteville, Norrey and Putot. The soldiers of The Regina Rifles and The Royal Winnipeg Rifles, still under-strength from their D-Day losses, wait their turn for the inevitable encounter with the Grenadiers of the 12th SS Panzer Division. The Canadian must hold their thin red line at all cost as failure to do so could result in a serious set back affecting the invasion time table and loss of the initiative to the Germans.<br/><br/>This game is a balanced, one-map knife fight between the highly motivated 12th SS Hitlerjugend and the equally matched Canadians determined to preserve and expand their D-Day bridgehead. In addition to the normal TCS serving, Canadian Crucible includes:<br/>&bull;Devastating Naval Bombardment<br/>&bull;Variable events table<br/>&bull;Historical and free setup options<br/>&bull;Panzer Meyer<br/>&bull;Discarding Sabot rounds<br/>&bull;Tigers<br/>&bull;Radio jamming<br/>&bull;Captured code books<br/>And much much more<br/><br/>',

        description: 'Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>First game in the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/>',

In starting phase of the battle enemy armies used elite airborne formations and later less experienced mechanized forces. In effect training and determination factors were balanced. Americans achieved success because of material advantage and better coordination of combined arms actions.<br/>Could the battle outcome have been different? On tactical level German fallschirmj&auml;gers had edge, because they were masters in using urban terrain. But lack of ammo and high casualties forced them to leave Carentan. On the other hand Americans used consistently artillery support and they gained ground step by step. These battlefield elements are shown in &quot;Great Battles of Small Units&quot; system. <br/>Two scenarios are included. <br/>&quot;Purple Heart Lane&quot; depicts struggle for Carentan between enemy paratroopers. Players can use optional rule and see what would be battle finale, if troops from 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division appeared earlier on the battlefield. <br/>The scenario &quot;Battle of Bloody Gulch&quot; shows American defence of Carentan against German counterattack.

Carthage concentrates on Punic events that take place in Carthage/Africa as well as Sicily, with the main scenario being the massive First Punic War. Building on the popular mechanics and systems of Rise of the Roman Republic (Vol I), Carthage includes the full, advances naval system, with galley battles, fleet building expanding ports, and everything featured in the unusual, truly naval war that was the First Punic War. In addition, the detailed political systems for both powers, the soul of the game and a set of mechanics that truly puts the players in the heart of ongoing events, are expanded and clarified. With the addition of rules for the Reduction and Repair of city defenses, militia, and the ability of garrisons to Sally, sieges are now more than just sideshows.<br/><br/>Carthage still uses The Ancient World's unique combat system, with its unusual Unpredictable Results, elephants, cavalry pursuit, and the dangers of fighting too many battles. Carthage's main scenario is, of course, the First Punic War, a twenty year affair that will take some time to play, but keep you entranced for years. The game also includes quick, one evening scenarios, including the playtester two-turn favorite Hiero; Hero or Gyro?, the twisty opening year of the First Punic War. We also have short scenarios for the first invasion of Carthage by Agathocles of Syracuse (311 BC) and the infamous Mercenary War that erupted in Carthage right after the First Punic War (241 BC).<br/><br/>Carthage contains one full-sized map - the slightly redone Italy map (we've expanded rivers to a three-tiered system and corrected some tangential map errata) - plus a half-map for Carthage and Africa. The 1000+ full-color counters include every Roman magistrate of the era plus lots of Libyans, Numidians, Egyptians, Iberians, Celts ... if they were there, they're in this game. Also, part of the game package is a expanded group of play-aid charts, prompted by playtester insistence, to help keep track of the many details that campaigning can require.<br/>Carthage is the Punic War's game that ancients and gaming aficionados have been waiting for since the beginning of the wargame hobby.

Some of the oil fields, and most of the city were taken.<br/><br/>Then the Red Army had its turn...<br/><br/>Case Blue is a game that covers both the Axis advance (1941 and 1942) as well as the Soviet counterattacks (Nov 42 to Jan 43) and the German counteroffensive at Kharkov (Feb-March 1943) that ended the series of campaigns in the south. The game covers in great detail all the operations from October 1941 until May 1943 on a large play area extending from Voronezh almost to the Turkish border. The full scope and grandiose nature of these operations come to life here.<br/><br/>Case Blue covers and replaces the 1994 award winning game Enemy at the Gates. Players get to encircle Stalingrad, run their pocket and relief attempts and the many operations that game covered.<br/><br/>Case Blue is the 10th game in the award winning Operational Combat System and is the result of over 6 years of intensive research and testing. Players control units ranging from battalions through divisions (OK, there are a few very strange companies), making key decisions on the use, objectives, and means of war. The series is based on modern concepts of maneuver warfare and allows players a far more insightful look into how campaigns (large and small) really work.<br/><br/>Case Blue is designed to be played both separately or linked to the 2001 game Guderian's Blitzkrieg II. The monster linked game allows players to run operations on the entire Eastern Front (except for Leningrad) from the fall of 1941 until mid-1943.<br/><br/>Multiple scenarios (one map to very large) allow play to be picked up at various key points in the campaign.<br/><br/>If you want a serious look at these pivotal campaigns while having fun at the same time, this is the game for you.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Operational Combat System finest hour, this game is huge.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: Half Week<br/>    Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>    Units: Company to Division<br/><br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    Nine 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets (Maps A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K)<br/>    One 14 x 22&quot; full-color mapsheet (Map E)<br/>    Ten dual-side printed countersheets (2,660 1/2&quot; Unit counters)<br/>    Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2&quot; Marker counters)<br/>    One 48-page OCS v4.0 series rules booklet<br/>    One 16-page Case Blue game rules booklet<br/>    One 80-page Case Blue Scenario Book 1<br/>    One 48-page Case Blue Scenario Book 2<br/>    One 24-page Case Blue Axis Booklet<br/>    One 24-page Case Blue Russian Booklet<br/>    Two 4-page two-color OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>(from MMP web site:)<br/><br/>",

        description: "In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.<br/><br/>Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.<br/><br/>A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.<br/><br/>Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.<br/><br/>CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.<br/><br/>Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.<br/><br/>",

He was the ultimate mounted armored warrior of the ancient world, trained in both shock and missile combat.<br/><br/>Cataphract portrays the development of the art of war wrought by the early Byzantine Empire, during the reign of Emperor Justinian, under his great Generals, Belisarius and Narses. During this period the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, for a brief period of time, re-captured a large portion of what was formerly the Western Roman Empire. Although successful in its attempts to reconquer Italy and North Africa, the Byzantine Empire's resources were insufficient to hold on to its gains.<br/><br/>Cataphract covers all the major battles that defined this era. To place these battles in their proper historical context, the Campaign Game, Justinian, is enclosed, which covers the quest to reconquer the Roman Empire under one ruler.<br/><br/>Thus, Cataphract contains the decisive battles of the era; a Campaign Game; plus a special bonus Viking raid scenario; and the land/naval leaders for an upcoming series of C3i Magazine Modules covering the Peloponnesian War. The second edition of Cataphract includes the Battles of the Utus River (447 CE) and the Catalaunian Fields (451 CE) from the original Attila: Scourge of God Module.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The player purposefully conducts the affairs of the Russian Empire and its allies, while the game system does the same for the anti-Russian coalition made up of a shifting alliance of powers.<br/><br/>Central to play of the game are its 'policy cards.' They trigger various strategies, powers at war, and other events that shape the general course of play. Policy cards are activated in one of two ways: the Empire player can choose which policies he will activate, while coalition policies are activated by the draw of markers. The Empire player may move his forces freely. The game system moves coalition forces according to a schedule of precedence.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is for the Russian Empire to have gained an advantageous position at the end of play, measured in terms of gaining certain objectives. The player must, however, also look toward maintaining the &quot;balance of power,&quot; or he may face disintegration of the entire European state system. Depending on how well the player attains his objectives, then, will really be the thing that determines the nature of victory.<br/><br/>While Catherine the Great has been purpose-designed to be a solitaire game, more than one can play at the same time as part of a Russian Empire command team. Players can divvy up responsibilities as they please for different parts of the Russian Empire, with the most veteran gamer taking the role of Czar and deciding who gets what resources.  Each region represents a distinct geographic area or province within a power. Each unit represents an entire army or fleet. Each turn represents five years.<br/><br/>",

        description: "The Caucasus Campaign: The Russo-German War - July - November, 1942<br/><br/>In late July of 1942, Hitler sent two strong armies south across the Don to seize the fertile Kuban and the oil of the Caucasus. Germany's 17th Army and 1st Panzer Army steamrolled over all opposition until they reached the mountains. There the Russians slowed and then stopped the Germans at the outskirts of Novorossisk, on the road to Tuapse and along the Terek River. This infuriated Hitler who then took over personal command of Army Group A and poured replacements and reinforcements into the area that were badly needed at Stalingrad. Eventually 27 Axis divisions were fighting south of the Don.<br/><br/>The Axis forces include 2 mountain divisions, 2 light (j&auml;ger) divisions, an SS motorized division (Wiking), and 3 panzer divisions -- two of which had three tank battalions while many on the east front have only one. The German army is accompanied by 1 Slovakian and 7 Romanian divisions.<br/><br/>The ranks of the Soviet army in the Caucasus is filled with Armenians, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Cossacks and Turkoman who have questionable loyalty. These divisions are reinforced by Soviet Guard and NKVD units sent across the Caspian, and by Soviet Naval troops stationed along the Black Sea.<br/><br/>The Caucasus Campaign is a quick playing, moderately complex game with large hexes and easy-viewing 5/8 counters. The game system is based on the classic Igo-Ugo/movement-combat-exploitation system, but modified with elements from Ardennes '44 (specifically: Determined Attacks and Defense and unit morale). The tournament scenario (6 turns) can be completely in roughly 2 hours. The full game is 14 turns long and can be finished in one sitting (approximately 5 hours).<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: 18 miles / 29 kilometers<br/>Units: Regiments to Divisions<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One &amp; 1/2 dual-side printed countersheets (264 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page The Caucasus Campaign rulebook<br/>Two dual-side printed Player Aid cards<br/>Ten small plastic baggies<br/>One 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-High<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3-6<br/><br/>",

        description: "Once upon a time ...<br/>1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.<br/><br/>The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.<br/><br/>As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.<br/><br/>",

        description: 'Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.<br/><br/>The game has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, and became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Ding Liren, China. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.<br/><br/>',

One of the more famous incidents of the campaign was the US Marine Corps 1st Division fighting its way out of an envelopment at the Chosin Reservoir. Chosin, designed by Joseph Miranda, covers the entire campaign using the same game system as Gauntlet, which appeared in Strategy &amp; Tactics 190. The two games are compatible, and the Strategic Scenario included in this issue provides instructions, as well as extra units, to create a combined Chosin/Gauntlet game of the entire Chinese offensive of 1950. Players can also use the Chosin rules and charts to update Gauntlet.<br/><br/>Each game turn equals one day. Each hex represents 2.5 miles (four kilometers). Units of maneuver are mostly UN regiments and brigades of 1,500 to 5,000 men, while each Communist divisional counter represents about 6,000 to 24,000 men. Each air UN unit represents 30 to 50 sorties. There are 280 NATO-style, small-size (half-inch) counters, including errata-fix replacements for Gauntlet.<br/><br/>Special rules cover: naval gunfire support, aerial combat operations, air transport, aerial supply, naval supply and troop transport, limited intelligence, bridge destruction and repair, fog of war, meeting engagements, organizational integrity, entrenchments, partisans, special forces, combat engineers, and the possibility of atomic warfare.

Eight teams race around the track three times to determine victory.  Players prepare for the race by selecting the composition of their team of horses, their rider's skills, and the type of chariot that will be driven.  Once the race begins the players are free to do as they wish to hamper the other racers including whipping the rider, ramming chariots with scythed wheels, smashing into horses, and running over crashed opponents.

There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).<br/><br/>The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.<br/><br/><br/>     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)<br/><br/><br/>The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.<br/><br/>Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.<br/><br/>For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.<br/><br/>The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail. Includes 520 counters.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Clash of Giants II: The Campaigns of Galicia and First Ypres, 1914 is the sequel to Ted Raicer's acclaimed Clash of Giants: Campaigns of Tannenberg and the Marne, 1914. As with the original design, CoG II contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering two of the most interesting (and least-gamed) campaigns of the First World War, Galicia and First Ypres .<br/><br/> Galicia 1914  pitted the armies of Tsarist Russia and Habsburg Austria-Hungary in a ferocious struggle along a 200 mile front. The Austrian commander, General Conrad, refused to wait for the arrival of his 2nd Army, which had been initially deployed to the Serbian front, before going onto the offensive. The Austrian attack began on 19 August, with Conrad's 1st and 4th Armies on the Austrian left flank striking the Russian 4th and 5th Armies on the Tsarist right. The Austrians outnumbered the Russians on this flank, and initially drove them back, and Conrad began to dream of pocketing the entire Russian army group. But the absence of the Austrian 2nd Army gave the Russians an even greater numerical advantage on the opposite flank, as two Russian armies (the 3rd and 8th) struck the Austrian 3rd east of Lemberg (Lvov). Soon it was Conrad's armies that were in danger of being cut off and destroyed. The campaign was a catastrophe for Austria-Hungary, but in the end the result was a fatally incomplete victory for the Russians.<br/><br/>The  First Ypres  game is the first game to cover the climax of the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot; on the Western Front that followed the inconclusive Allied victory at the Marne. By 8 October the continued outflanking attempts by both sides had nearly reached the English Channel. A massive meeting engagement developed, with the Germans first attempting to launch a massive cavalry raid around the Allied northern flank in the direction of Abbeville. When this fizzled (due to the timely arrival of a French infantry corps), the French and British began their own offensive aimed at driving all the way to the German border. But the Allied attack quickly ran into German troops of the 6th Army, hurried north from Alsace-Lorraine. Falkenhayn, the German commander, now planned to play his trump card, striking the BEF with four newly-raised reserve corps of hurriedly-trained but enthusiastic volunteers. In a month of brutal struggle in which the British lost 60,000 men, the Germans lost well over 100,000. Not realizing that the BEF had been bled white and was on the point of breaking, Falkenhayn called off his attacks in mid-November. The attempts to end the war by Christmas were over.<br/><br/>Clash of Giants II uses a slightly modified version of the original system to model these dynamic and closely balanced contests. As in Clash of Giants, the game emphasizes the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll. But CoGII adds an interactive random chit-pull activation sequence, so that neither player knows which of his commands will move next. Each player has only one combat phase per turn, which he may declare at the end of any one of his command activations, but which covers the entire map. This leads to many difficult game decisions: &quot;Do I declare combat now, with only part of my forces in position to attack, or wait hoping to get more units into the line, but risking the enemy either pulling back or striking first?&quot;<br/><br/>Once combat is declared, CoGII uses the unique combat system so popular in Tannenberg and Marne, in which a unit's training, equipment, and morale are factored into a Tactical Effiency Rating that often counts more than mere numbers.<br/><br/>Galicia 1914 includes a corps/division OB and a map scaled at 9 miles to the hex that covers the entire front from Krakow to the Romanian border. The victory conditions force the Austrian player to attack initially in order to gain enough VPs to survive the strong Russian offensive certain to follow. Galicia features special rules for the great Austrian fortress of Przemysl, Russian cavalry replacements, rail supply, Offensive Support Markers (representing heavy artillery and the logistical and command preparations of a major assault), and the arrival of the Austrian 2nd Army.<br/>The OB for First Ypres is at division level (with the odd brigade). The map scale is 3.3 miles to the hex, from Lens in the south to the English Channel. Special rules include Offensive Support Markers, the Belgian retreat onto the map from Antwerp, flooding the Yser River line, French and German cavalry replacements, unknown Tactical Efficiency Ratings for the German New Reserve Corps, and British tenacity (represented by remnant counters). Victory goes to the player who controls 5 of the 9 victory hexes at the end of the game, and the game is sometimes decided on the final combat roll by a last-ditch attack or defense of a single key hex.<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>    One 22&quot; x 34&quot; backprinted game map<br/>    Two 8.5 x 11 Player Aid Cards<br/>    Two 5/8&quot; Countersheets<br/>    Two Six-sided Dice<br/><br/><br/>(from GMT Games website)<br/><br/>",

        description: "Clash of Giants contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering the two most famous battles of the opening phase of the First World War. Tannenberg was the German victory that halted a Russian offensive into East Prussia and destroyed the Russian 2nd Army. The Marne was the climactic battle of Germany's attempt to defeat France in the war's first six weeks. Arguably a tactical draw, it was a strategic defeat for the Germans as their armies recoiled from the gates of Paris.<br/><br/>Designed by eight-time Charles S. Roberts award winner Ted S. Raicer (whose most recent game was GMT's Paths of Glory), and developed by Krieg designer Steve Kosakowski, the Clash of Giants system is intended to emphasize playability while still providing players with proper historical feel. The games focus on the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll.<br/><br/>Clash of Giants includes the standard and exclusive rules (including rules for Paris Taxis at the Marne and Geman wireless intercepts at Tannenberg), two full size large-hex maps, two player aid cards, and 264 large counters. Units are divisions and brigades.<br/><br/>Simple but not simplistic, Clash of Giants has a unique combat system based more on a unit's training, equipment, and morale than numbers. In Tannenberg, the victory conditions force both sides to take risks - and the German player will have to use every advantage to avoid being crushed by superior Russian numbers. At the Marne, the Allied player will first have to successfully disengage and rally his French and British armies, before turning to deliver a powerful counterattack. (But don't forget that the Germans can win instantly if they take Paris!)<br/><br/>The two battles in Clash of Giants [...] are good for solo or competitive play. The Marne (which contains an Allied Counterattack scenario in addition to the full campaign) can be played in an afternoon.

The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill, Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly. Each battle die has one Light, one Medium, one Heavy, one Leader, one Flag and one Swords symbol.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, historical tactics, timely dice rolling, and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan, to achieve victory.&quot;<br/><br/>",

A game system that allows players to effectively portray stylized Ancient historical battles that play to a conclusion in less than an hour.<br/><br/>In this expansion we have taken the opportunity to present a number of battles that we just did not have room to include in prior expansions. The Romans fight in Britain at Medway 43AD, against Boudica at Watling Street 61 AD, and later at Mons Graupius 84AD. Antony and Octavian of the Second Triumvirate battle it out twice with Cassius and Brutus at Philippi 42BC. But the main focus of this expansion is Rome's conflicts against the Parthian Empire, Teutonic Barbarians and internal turmoil of civil wars until Constantine becomes the undisputed Roman Emperor around 325AD.<br/><br/>Imperial Rome is packed full of unique and interesting play concepts and new units: cataphracted cavalry, wagon laager forts, massed units of horse archers, light infantry tossing caltrops and more. Each of these concepts operates within the confines of the original system rules, with only slight modifications to reflect historical abilities and importance. So, rules-wise, if you own Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients, you'll have no trouble learning the few new special rules.<br/><br/>Important: In order to play the scenarios in the Imperial Rome expansion, you will need a copy of the basic Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients game and copies of Expansion Nr. 1 Greek vs The Eastern Kingdoms and Expansion Nr. 2 Rome vs The Barbarians.

The battle started as a meeting engagement, ending in a massive fighting. It  was a crushing defeat of the Italian colours, but the Third Independence War still finally gave Veneto to the Kingdom of Italy, because of its alliance with Prussia, who was winning the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.<br/><br/>﻿﻿<br/><br/>',

Units are companies and include assaulting infantry, engineers and amphibious tanks. The game system controls the hidden German defenders in their &quot;Widerstandsnest&quot; resistance points, revealing the defenders and their reserves as the American survivors of the first landing waves make their way up the bluffs.

Players take the sides of the German 726th Infantry Regiment or elite US Army Rangers of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. Following an unprecedented invasion by landing and cliff-scaling in the face of enemy fire, the battle devolved into the quintessential hedgerow battle in Normandy&rsquo;s bocage. The Rangers were literally &lsquo;backs to the sea&rsquo;, cut off from friendly forces until a relief column reached them from Omaha Beach on 8 June 1944. The German defenders pushed James Rudder and his men to the point of annihilation. It was a &lsquo;near run thing&rsquo;.<br/>The game depicts the hedgerow fighting that followed the D-Day landing of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. It is meant to be a hard-hitting, fast playing board game that recreates the close-in and deadly nature of the battle, fought for each individual field.<br/><br/>Game Scale: The game is scaled at about 100 yards to the inch. Units for both sides are small groups of soldiers approximating squads, non-commissioned officers, FO&rsquo;s, weapons crews, and individual machine-guns, mortars, and shoulder-fired Bazooka and Panzerschreck rocket launchers. Each game turn represents six hours.<br/><br/>Game Board: The game board uses a US Army map of the battlefield, divided into a collection of 35 numbered areas or &lsquo;sectors&rsquo;.

        description: "This is low-to intermediate-complexity, two-player, examination of the historic alternative to Montgomery's ill-fated Operation Market Garden. Instead of his left-jab through lowland Holland to the Rhine, we have Patton's proposed right-hook, starting at Metz and swinging north and east toward the Ruhr for a war-winning knockout blow. Or, as an alternative within an alternative, the Allied player may try for a more conservative push straight east to the Rhine, there to create a bridgehead over that German river, thereby likely advancing the advent of V-E Day by at least three or four months.<br/><br/>As soon as you begin to game Patton's alternative to Montgomery's all or nothing plan, it becomes clear what a huge opportunity Eisenhower missed by backing the wrong subordinate. That is, for the British field marshal's plan to have succeeded, it really did have to go all the way, or at least get across the Rhine in some significant way. Failing short of both the Rhine and the Ruhr, as happened historically, meant a month had been wasted and a lot of lives lost only to create a salient to nowhere. Had Patton's idea been tried, only to fail as badly, a salient of that same size &ndash; but  jutting north into the Rhineland from a base at Metz &ndash; would've done much more for the Allied cause.<br/><br/>We've broadened the appeal of this design beyond those who enjoy alternative history by including a second, historical, scenario. At first we were only going to cover the actual Market-Garden portion of Montgomery's operations in September 1944. It quickly became apparent, however, portrayed at these time, space and unit scales, such a game would be a dud, with a map only nine hexes long and three wide. So we broadened the thing's shoulders by expanding the coverage to take in all Montgomery's possibilities that fateful month. So now you can choose a straight-up historic approach, or you can have alternative history within your actual history.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map equals seven miles from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents three days. Playing pieces represent divisions, brigades, combat commands, Kampfgruppen and regiments of various kinds of infantry and armor formations, each containing from about 3,000 to 14,000 men and 50 to 400 or so armored fighting vehicles.<br/><br/>",

        description: "&quot;Crossroads&quot; is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Dead of Winter is GMT&rsquo;s recreation of Richard Berg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Battles of the American Civil War series&rdquo; series title on the battle of Murfreesboro; also known as The Battle of Stone&rsquo;s River to Union Veterans. Perhaps one of the most evenly matched battles of the war, Murfreesboro/Stone&rsquo;s River pitted the Federal Army of the Cumberland under Major General William Starke Rosecrans against the Confederate Army of Tennessee captained by General Braxton Bragg. With near parity of numbers (each side fielded roughly 40,000 men) and remarkably similar battle plans, both armies grappled in the December cold for control of Middle Tennessee.<br/><br/>The Series:<br/><br/>The GBACW Series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental Level Gettysburg game - Terrible Swift Sword - created by Richard Berg in 1976. Since then, the series has undergone numerous system evolutions, always seeking to enhance the player&rsquo;s illusion of reality. Today, the series relies on inter-active chit-pull mechanics to simulate the sometimes chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield. GMT's Red Badge Of Courage and Gringo! Are the two most recent releases in this classic line of games.<br/><br/>The Game:<br/>Dead of Winter II completely revisits this battle. The old version needed a face-lift. The biggest change is in returning the ground scale to 110 yards per hex.  While going to the larger scale means an increase in maps, the added elbow room allows for much more historical unit frontages and more playable stacking.<br/> One Introductory and ten regular scenarios examine every aspect of the historical battle and present the players with several plausible alternative situations based on events leading up to the actual engagement. Scenario sizes range from one-half of one map and an hour to play, to all four maps and many enjoyable gaming hours. Also included are a number of optional forces that could have plausibly been brought into the fight; Keep your opponent guessing as to what he will face next with this interesting range of options.<br/><br/>The Team: <br/>While Richard Berg remains the final authority for all things GBACW, and John Alsen continues his invaluable role in the development of each title, Dead of Winter II adds one more well-known gaming name to the mix: Designer Dave Powell. Dave has designed more than a dozen civil war simulation games with The Gamers, Inc, (now owned by MMP.) Dave has always loved the GBACW since the moment he first opened the box for TSS, and welcomed the chance to bring his design talents and historical skills to the Dead of Winter project.<br/><br/>The GMT game is the revised second version of Dead of Winter: The Battle of Stones River – Murfreesboro, Tennessee by Simulation Design, Inc..<br/><br/><br/>Game Design: Dave Powell<br/>Series Design: Richard H.

        description: "DEATH IN THE TRENCHES is a strategic-level World War I game covering the entire war, from the opening shots in Serbia and Belgium to the final defeat -- or victory! -- of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1918. The game includes a map stretching from the Pyrenees to Moscow, and from Norway to the Sudan, covering every square inch of territory in Europe and the Near East which saw combat from 1914 to 1918, in a manageable 34x22&quot; format. An additional map shows the German colonies<br/><br/>The game also features 400 beautifully-illustrated counters depicting the national armies that fought in the war -- from the Germans, French, British and Russians all the way down to the Persians, Montenegrins, Armenians, South Africans, and a host of other specialized units (French Foreign Legion, Gurkhas, Italian &quot;Arditi&quot;, Cossacks, Tyrolean Kaiserjaeger, Zionists, Bavarians, &quot;Dunsterforce&quot;... even the Chinese may send a small expeditionary force).<br/><br/>DEATH IN THE TRENCHES includes a deceptively simple twelve pages of rules (and an additional twelve pages of random events) detailing the game's unique combat system (no CRT!) which portrays the grinding nature of World War I combat in a realistic way that still gives players plenty of options to pursue. Using army-level units (which contain numbers of divisional level formations, represented off-map), players use numerous special military abilities to drive back the enemy.<br/><br/>Detailed random events rules give you more gory details about World War I than you've ever seen before in a game, while helping keep play simple and straightforward. Lenin, the Senussi revolt, intrigue in the Romanian court, the Cruise of the Emden, the Armenian Massacre, the Sinai Pipeline, the Ukrainian Reactionary Hetmanate, Rasputin, Mata Hari, the Russian shell shortage, the murder of Edith Cavell, Wilhelm Wassmuss (the &quot;German Lawrence&quot;), Lawrence of Arabia, the Nestorian resistance, Pancho Villa, the Grand Duke Nicholas, Thomas Masaryk, the Red Baron, Czech Legion, Irish Rising, Berber Revolt, air raids, typhus, influenza... they're all here.<br/><br/>For the World War I buff, &quot;DITT&quot; has everything: Tanks, Alpenkorps, artillery barrages, flamethrowers, poison gas, Krupp guns, Mustapha Kemal, the Royal Air Force, French elan... while the great wartime leaders all leave their mark (good or bad!) on history: Bruchmuller, Haig, Hoffmann, Mackensen, Hindenburg and Ludendorff, Rennenkampf and Samsonov, Sarrail, Von Francois, Foch, Brusilov, Nivelle, Plehve, Putnik, Yudenich... they're all here. Players command the armed forces of nearly forty nations, in a game that still manages to be small enough to fit on your table!<br/><br/>It sounds like a massive game, but it isn't. DEATH IN THE TRENCHES is designed to be played--easy to play, hard to master. You'll learn things about World War I you never knew before, and you'll have to face the same crises the leaders of the Entente and Central Powers did. Think you can do better than Douglas Haig and Robert Nivelle? Now it's your turn.<br/><br/>Death in the Trenches won the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.<br/><br/>",

Neither side was fully aware of the other&rsquo;s position. Faced with the unknown both armies conformed to type with the French defending strongly and the Germans attacking. For once, though, the French far outnumbered the Germans. As a result a heavily outnumbered German army was forced to make a series of attacks to prevent the French discovering its weakness and to deny the French their retreat to the west.<br/><br/>Had the French pushed the Germans aside they would have been able to combine their armies and possibly protect Paris.

        description: "Decision at Kasserine: Rommel's Last Chance, Designer Signature Edition, marks the return of a true wargaming classic by Vance von Borries first published in 1983, faithfully remastered and updated with this all-new, supersized edition. Hailed by many as of the premier entry in the popular Series: Battles for North Africa (3W) series, this two-player operational level simulation covers the WWII German and Italian offensive in central Tunisia which took place in mid-February 1943.<br/><br/>This edition of Decision at Kasserine features a super-sized map and counters and is another Classic Reborn! by Compass.<br/><br/>On the morning of February 19, the Germans launched their attack through the Kasserine Pass. Heavy damage was inflicted on the Allied forces, causing the Allies to retreat 50 miles. Despite these losses and setbacks, Allied forces and reserves managed to regroup and hold on February 22, launching a massive artillery attack to halt the German advances. Faced with his own overextended supply lines and an Allied force that was now being reinforced, Rommel withdrew and ordered all Axis units to concentrate on defending the German-held coastal areas. Had the German-Italian army succeeded, the war in North Africa would have been lengthened, thus possibly delaying the Allied invasion of Europe.This offensive was the last major Axis effort which offered a realistic chance to reverse their fortunes in North Africa.<br/><br/>This Designer Signature edition of the classic Vance von Borries game goes beyond a mere culmination of the forward strides made with subsequent games published in the series; it now features a major update to the game system that will be implemented in future game releases of the popular Series: Battles for North Africa (3W) series. In terms of superior physical presentation, all aspects have been upgraded, including super-sized components; larger game map and 5/8&quot; counters. Some of the enhancements made in this edition include:<br/><br/>&bull; Super-sized components feature 5/8&rdquo; counters and two game maps with large hexes<br/>&bull; Game map information is updated and includes all-new map artwork<br/>&bull; Supporting charts convey more information at a glance for ease of play<br/>&bull; Enhanced ergonomics are built into the set up and reinforcement charts<br/>&bull; Updated the Order of Battle based on new information and analysis<br/>&bull; Fixed the original deployment and OoB based on archival information<br/>&bull; The rules treatment is all-new with a full re-write backed by many illustrations, an index, and clarifications and examples of play to reduce potential questions.

        description: "The topic of the game is the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union.<br/> Players control the actual units that fought in the campaign. Axis units mostly represent army corps. These include German, Finnish, Italian, Hungarian, Spanish and Romanian units. German tank units provide the real striking power for the Axis, and these are the strongest units in the game. The German infantry is also numerous and strong. The other Axis units are not usually as powerful as the German ones, though the Hungarian unit is good and there is a Romanian cavalry corps.<br/><br/>Soviet units are generally armies. Some of these are able to stand up to the Germans, but most cannot; while the Soviets start out with a very powerful army the first Axis turn is rough on the Red Army.  The Soviet player must place his or her forces carefully and choose the time and place for counter-attacks. The Soviet player does have the aid of fleets in both the Baltic and the Black Seas, allowing landings behind enemy lines and sometimes support in combat. The Red Army of Workers and Peasants has many tank units, but they are not as strong as the German panzers. It can counter with paratroopers and shock troops, special units not available to the Axis.<br/><br/>The original game was published in 2004.  The 2016, Avalanche Press released an updated &quot;Player's Edition&quot;, more pieces, a larger map and more scenarios.  There are 200 playing pieces in the Player's Edition (the first edition had 140) and a 28x22-inch map (the first edition&rsquo;s was 22x17 inches) by Guy Riessen. There&rsquo;s an introductory scenario for the 1939 German invasion of Poland, but the main event is the 1941 Axis attack on the Soviet Union. There are additional scenarios built around Operation Barbarossa plus variations like Turkish intervention.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Destruction of Army Group Center: The Soviet Summer Offensive, 1944, is a simulation on a corps/division level of the Russian Summer Offensive of 1944 on the Eastern Front (Operation Bagration). Historically this offensive destroyed one entire Nazi Army Group, and prevented large transfers of men and equipment to the newly formed Western Front where the Anglo-American forces were expanding their beachhead in preparation for the August Breakout. The game covers the first twenty days of the offensive, during which all the decisive action took place. There are several scenarios, depicting a variety of likely possibilities, from the historical one through various degrees of German preparedness and 'sanity'.&quot;<br/><br/>Units represent Russian corps and Axis divisions. Stacking limit is 3 units/hex. Players alternate moves. Order of phases in each movement turn is: movement phase, combat phase, second mechanized movement phase. Semi-active zones of control extend into adjacent hexes, with some exceptions. Units pay two extra movement points to enter or leave an enemy zone of control, and may move directly from one controlled hex to another if they have enough movement points. Attacking is voluntary. Combat results involve unit eliminations, exchanges, and retreats, but the Axis mechanized units have a modified step-reduction mechanism (an eliminated Axis mechanized unit is replaced by a weak battlegroup which has no zone of control, and is worth extra victory points to the Russian player if it's eliminated in a later combat).<br/><br/>Victory is determined by victory points, gained by eliminating enemy units and, for the German player, for failure by the Russian player to have a continuous line from the north to the south board edge at the end of his turn.<br/><br/>Four scenarios are provided, ranging from the historical one where Hitler's propensity for issuing &quot;Stand Fast&quot; orders finally caught up with the Axis, to the maximum withdrawal scenario, in which the Axis essentially eliminates the portion of the front historically covered by Army Group North and uses the forces of that Army Group to strengthen the resulting greatly-shortened line in the Army Group Center area.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 days<br/>Hex: 10 miles / 16 km<br/>Units: Kampfgruppe to Corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 28&quot; map<br/>One single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One foldout rules folder (folds out to 10 pages)<br/><br/>",

        description: "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>The one thing that Down in Flames series players are always looking for is additional aircraft for their favorite game series. So we have decided to satisfy that desire with our first C3i-DiF Squadron aircraft pack. This pack consists of 64 fighter aircraft cards, printed in the eight-per-sheet (cut 'em out yourself) style of C3i-DiF module inserts that you've enjoyed over the years. Most of the aircraft cards are NEW aircraft types, although we have included a few reprints (with corrected ratings) of aircraft that have appeared previously in one or more of the DiF Series games.<br/><br/>Included are such important aircraft as the British Typhoon and Tempest, the German Bf-109G-6/R6 and Fw-190F and the American P-63A Kingcobra (which was used extensively in combat by the Soviet air force). The pack also contains a number of more obscure but interesting aircraft, like the Rumanian IAR 80, the German TA-152H and the Polish PzL 24, the only fighter in the Greek inventory at the time of the Italian invasion in 1941. Speaking of the Italians, there are a number of Mussolini's fighters in the pack as well, including the Cr42 Falco, the M.C. 202 Folgore and the G.50bis Freccia. All of these planes are done in the upgraded graphic style of Corsairs and Hellcats, courtesy of Dave Lawrence, Martin Scott and Rodger MacGowan.<br/><br/>The package is wrapped in a ziplock format with an 11&quot; x 17&quot; (folded) cover/rulesbook. The front cover is graced with Rodger MacGowan's gorgeous DiF Series style artwork, while the inside will contain the rules necessary to use the aircraft in DiF dogfights. Some of the rules will be reprints from Zero!: The Rise and Fall of The Imperial Japanese Air Force Dec 1941 - June 1942 and Corsairs and Hellcats for the benefit of those players who only own the European Theatre DiF series volumes (Rise of the Luftwaffe and Eighth Air Force). There will also be a few new rules. For example, ace researcher Chris Janiec has come up with a way of modeling aircraft carrying a single, large caliber cannon, such as the P-39.<br/><br/>If this first C3i-DiF Squadron Pack proves to be popular, we're planning a series of these expansion packs. This is your chance to expand your Down in Flames series air force and add new aircraft cards at a very low price. Enjoy the games!<br/><br/>",

        description: "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Following on the heels of the first Squadron Pack for the Down in Flames series of WWII air combat card games comes Squadron Pack 2: Bombers. While the first pack contained new fighters, this one adds more Light Bombers and Formation aircraft to the  system.<br/><br/>The pack will include such famous aircraft as the B-25H (complete with 75mm gun) and the Il-2m3 Shturmovik. But there will be lesser-known planes as well, like the German Hs-129B-1/R2 (a sort of WWII version of today's A-10) and the Italian CANT Z.501 Gabbiano flying boat. All the cards will be printed in the eight-per-sheet (cut 'em out yourself) style of C3i-DiF module inserts that you've enjoyed over the years.<br/><br/>One of the difficulties in creating a pack of bombers and patrol planes is that up until now these aircraft types have only been used in the context of a Down in Flames campaign. The rules included in the pack provide three ways around this problem. First, there are guidelines for adding Formation aircraft to basic game dogfights. Second, the pack includes a number of stand-alone generic missions into which players can simply &quot;plug in&quot; appropriate aircraft. Finally, we have included rules (courtesy of Roger Horky) that allow Formation aircraft to engage in a form of dogfighting (called Gunnery Duels in the game) with other Formation planes. So if you've ever wanted to fly a Short Stirling against an FW-200 Condor, now is your chance.<br/><br/>Squadron Pack 2's rules also contain reprints of some of the rules from Corsairs and Hellcats for the benefit of those players who don't own that game (you know who you are). In addition, there are rules for two new ground attack weapons: the German Hs 293 radio-controlled air to surface missile and Fritz X radio-controlled glide bomb.<br/><br/>Like the first pack, Squadron Pack 2: Bombers will contain 64 new aircraft cards printed 8 to a sheet in the same enhanced graphic style as Squadron Pack 1. The pack will also include a short (4-8 page) rulebook and an 11x17 wrap around cover decorated with Rodger MacGowan's gorgeous artwork. The inside of the cover sheet will form a play mat for use during Gunnery Duels.<br/><br/>Developers: Mike Lemick and Rodger B. MacGowan<br/><br/>",

        description: "(from the publisher:)<br/><br/>Downfall is a wargame simulating the planned but never executed US invasion of the Japanese home island of Kyushu during the last quarter of that year. The design combines factual historical detail with educated guesswork to produce an alternative history simulation covering the period from X-Day +1 through X-Day +30. One player acts as the overall commander of the Allied invasion effort; the other takes the role of the leader of the Japanese defense force. The burden of attack is generally on the American, but both players attempt to win by controlling key terrain on the island and destroying opposing forces. A complete game of DF takes from two to four hours to complete and it's suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>The approach we've taken here is called, among those who deal regularly with alternative history &ndash; which is itself also known as &quot;virtual history&quot; and &quot;alternative outcome analysis &ndash; the conservation of historical reality. That is, to make the assumptions and results of our simulation as valid as possible, we made the fewest possible changes needed to the historic timeline in order to put our alternative one in place. The basic assumption here, then, is that the Japanese simply refused to surrender after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That would have likely meant one or another of the coups plotted during those desperate days actually went through, putting in place a new war cabinet of ultimate hard liners, men determined Japan should fight to the end no matter what.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map equals 4.4 miles (about 7 kms) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents one day. Every ground unit represents a division, division-equivalent, or brigade of about 5,000 to 20,000 men and/or 50 to 350 armored fighting vehicles.

This game has been built around two basic situations: the historical invasion and a hypothetical one, covering the chance of German intervention. In both cases it remains a two player wargame with each player alternately moving his pieces and resolving combat in succession. Whilst the game reproduces the situation that faced the historical commanders, the outcome will depend upon the decisions taken by players; it is perfectly possible to change the course of history.<br/><br/>Drive on Damascus uses a peculiar hexagon grid game map in which only the central dot of each hex is depicted.<br/>British forces try to preempt an attack from the Vichy French staged in Syria in 1941.<br/><br/>This wargame can be run as part of a campaign with O'Connor's Offensive, Hellfire Pass and Bloody Keren (which is where the campaign rules are to be found).<br/><br/>Published 1981, in The Wargamer Magazine issue #15<br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>     Syria, 1941<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 3.2 miles / 5.15 kilometers<br/>Units: Company to Battalion<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 23 x 32&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One single-side printed countersheet (260 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 12-page Drive on Damascus rulebook (in magazine)<br/>Player will have to provide one 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>",

The designer has added new pieces and scenarios to this edition of the game.<br/><br/>This 2-player game recreates General Patton's attempt to seize the key city of Metz and to get across the Moselle River before the retreating Germans can form an effective defense.  The U.S. forces comprised of three divisions of the 20th Corps had just completed an epic pursuit across France after the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead.  The exhausted Allied forces were at the end of their supply line and has barely enough resources left for one last push. If they had been able to get across the Moselle River, they would have compromised the entire German Westwall defenses. This would have enabled Patton to make an attempt at crossing the Rhine before the end of 1944 and might have ended the war months earlier.

        description: "Drive on Moscow (DoM) is a two-player, low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic-level simulation of the final German attempt to capture the capital city of the Soviet Union late in 1941. The German player is generally on the offensive, attempting to win the game by isolating or capturing Moscow, or by seizing all the other key cities on map. The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also requires that he prosecute local counterattacks.<br/><br/>Play encompasses the period that began with the Germans launching their offensive on 1 October 1941 and ends on 7 December of the same year. By that time it had become clear the invaders had shot their bolt without achieving their objective. Play may end sooner than the historic termination time if either player concedes defeat prior to the official end of a game.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with some brigades and one elite super-elite regiment. The effects of the general air superiority enjoyed by the Germans throughout much of the campaign are built into the game's movement and combat rules. Each game turn represents a week.

        description: "Drive on Paris, is a game simulating the first 100 days of fighting on the Western Front during World War I.<br/><br/>The mobile campaign of 1914 in the west was the result of more than a generation of staff planning on both sides. The German General Staff had prepared the Schlieffen Master Plan of a giant right hook into France which its namesake had hoped would result in a Cannae-like battle of annihilation of France. The French believing that an attack would always win and that elan would carry the day, prepared to assault the lightly held German lines in Alsalce-Lorraine.<br/><br/>Both plans failed.<br/><br/>Drive on Paris allows both sides to execute the historical campaigns or variations on them and are rated for victory on how well their operation succeeds. Players can rearrange their Mobilization Points to change the change the force allocations from the historical ones to reinforce their effort or to better counter the enemy's.<br/><br/>Both side must rapidly attack and defend at the same time...and you'll never have enough troops and power to do both perfectly, so your allocation of scarce resources will be the key to your success.<br/><br/>This system uses a two-tracked method of determining victory. It isn't the usual &quot;one side tries something, while the other tries to stop it&quot;. Rather, both sides must strive toward their own goals while putting forth enough effort to stall the enemy. It is possible for both sides to &quot;win&quot; ending the game in a net draw (which is why you'll need to dedicate some effort to stopping the enemy support).<br/><br/>Drive on Paris is the seventh game in the popular, easy-to-play Standard Combat Series. These games are designed to be easy enough for novice players, yet meaty enough to retain the interest of veterans. It violates two principals of game design at the same time: Easy games are dumb, and the converse that interesting games are hard.

At the same time the Protestant Reformation, which was sweeping Europe, found ready acceptance among the affluent, literate Dutch. There was little enough to bind the independent-minded Dutch to the distant Habsburg possessions in Spain and Austria, but the devout Catholicism of the Emperors and their Inquisition now made war inevitable. When the rebellion commenced in 1566, neither side foresaw either the decades of bloody civil war or the formation of an independent Dutch State.<br/><br/>The Dutch Revolt is a simulation of this conflict.

Had they succeeded in stabilizing a supplied bridgehead on the Flanders coast, or managed to smash the thinly-spread German mechanized formations while breaking out southward, all of subsequent World War II history would have been changed.

        description: "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun (EotS) is Mark Herman's third card driven design since he introduced the system to the hobby in We The People. EotS is a strategic level look at the entire War in the Pacific from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the surrender of Japan. EotS is the first card driven game (CDG) to move the system closer to a classic hexagon wargame, while retaining all of the tension and uncertainty people have come to expect from a CDG. Players are cast in the role of MacArthur, Yamamoto, Nimitz, and Mountbatten as you direct your forces across the breadth of the globe from India to Hawaii and from Alaska to Australia. This is represented on a single map based on a 1942 equal area projection of the entire theater of conflict.<br/><br/>As in other games using the CDG system, players try to maximize the impact of their cards even as they hide their intentions and traps from their opponent. The player is faced with a wide set of clear strategic choices. The focus of EotS is on directing major offensive axes of advance. The Japanese early in the game are challenged to achieve their historical expansion as Allied forces battle the clock to react with their in-place forces trying to achieve maximum damage to the hard-to-replace Japanese veteran units.<br/><br/>Combat in EotS is based on successfully bringing superior combined land, air, and sea forces to bear in a two-tiered combat system. The first tier is the resolution of air-naval combat, the second tier covers ground combat. The culmination of both tiers results in one side prevailing in battle.<br/><br/>The key variable in determining strategic victory is the level of U.S. political will. The Japanese win the game by forcing the U.S. into a negotiated peace, which was not achieved historically. The Japanese achieve this by knocking countries like India, China, and Australia out of the war, while inflicting massive casualties on the United States. The delivery of the A-bomb on its historical schedule is not a guarantee, often necessitating Operation Olympic and the invasion of Japan. It is often in its darkest hour that the Japanese find victory in EotS.<br/>EotS scenarios were designed with the busy enthusiast, grognard, and competitive tournament player in mind. EotS was designed to be played n yearly scenarios (1942, 1943, and 1944) of three turns each that play in under two hours. If you are a fan of CDG's, EotS takes the genre into a familiar, but new direction. If you are a fan of classic hexagon wargames, this game has all of the features that brought you to this hobby in the first place, but with a new level of excitement and replayability. The game is comprehensive, but easy to learn.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 4 months per turn<br/>MAP SCALE: 150 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE: Brigade, Division, Corps, and Army<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Mark Herman<br/>DEVELOPER: Stephen Newberg<br/>MAP &amp; CARD ART: Mark Simonitch<br/>COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch, Dave Lawrence, &amp; Rodger B. MacGowan<br/><br/><br/>(from the designer:)<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun (EOTS), uses a variant of my card driven system. The game has one map that covers the Pacific Theater of operations from India to Hawaii, and from the Aleutians to Australia. EOTS is the first card driven game to use hexes, which facilitates calculating movement and aircraft ranges. Each game turn covers 4 months (three turns per year) with a special December 41 (special two card) game turn, for a total of 12 game turns for the campaign.<br/><br/>The game is at the strategic level using naval units built around a capital ship class (e.g., CV Wasp, BB Washington, etc.), air units at the Air Force/ Air Flotilla/ Air Division level, and most ground units are Corps/ Armies although there are a host of specialized units at the division and below level. The game has 165 cards divided into an Allied and a Japanese deck.<br/><br/>The game uses a two tiered combat system with air-naval combat preceding ground combat. The system has players roll for combat efficiency, which is a strength multiplier from .5 to 2. This value multiplied by the unit strengths is the number of hits the enemy takes in combat, with some special conditions based on number of CVs present and the like.<br/><br/>As far as game play is concerned, China is abstracted using a track whereby the play of certain events and Chinese offensives puts pressure on the Allies to support this theater with resources or see it fall and hurt Allied morale. This is balanced against the fact that Japanese land replacements come from this theater, so the more they draw it down for conflict in other locations, the more likely China will survive.<br/><br/>Northern India and Burma are active theaters of operation where the majority of the continuous ground warfare in the game occurs. If the Japanese can successfully occupy Northern India, they can drive this nation and its Commonwealth units out of the war.<br/><br/>Australia can also be knocked out of the war, although it is hard to keep it out permanently.<br/><br/>Then of course there is the famous island campaigns with the US driving across the Pacific to knock Japan out of the war.<br/><br/>",

        description: 'The Fast Action Battle (FAB) Series - Volume 1: The Bulge<br/><br/>From Rick Young, designer of Europe Engulfed, comes a series of fun, tense block games. FAB games focus on speed and playability with low-unit density while keeping the history both accurate and exciting.<br/><br/>Volume 1: The Bulge brings you the Battle of the Bulge from December 16th through December 27th. You command the division and brigade level units using the historical orders of battle. You order your forces to key points, and decide how and when to order extra Assets to bolster them. Note that there are never enough of these Assets to give to all the units begging for them, so you need to weigh your decisions carefully.<br/><br/>FAB delivers a new blend of units and decisions to the block game genre: your forces are a mixture of wooden blocks and die-cut counters.<br/><br/><br/>     Blocks: your divisions and brigades are multi-step wooden blocks with printed labels on one side only, with step-losses represented by rotating the blocks. FAB has a new twist on the units in that the pips on the edges of the blocks are color coded to represent troop quality, which can change as a Division suffers losses. Elite Units can lose their edge and become Veteran, while Green Units can harden and become Veteran as they experience the strains of combat. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Counters: Die-cut counters represent (1) additional Assets available to you as the Field Commander and (2) major Events that could have or did occur during the battle. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Assets represent engineers, army level artillery, independent armor and infantry regiments/battalions, and other small units that can be temporarily assigned to the battles that you deem important to your strategy. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Randomly drawn Events provide divisional replacements, air strikes, interdiction teams, parachute drops, and events unique to each battle in the Series. These Events represent unique opportunities which you can use to influence the outcome, although you cannot count on exactly when these opportunities will be available to you. <br/><br/><br/>Another strong element of FAB is the return of Special Actions, which have already been proven in GMT&rsquo;s Europe Engulfed design to give flexible, exciting game play. Special Actions give you tense choices in deciding how and when to seize initiative or interfere with a sudden move by your opponent.<br/><br/>Series Designer: Rick Young<br/>Series Developer: John Foley<br/>Published: 2007<br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Wargameroom (real-time)<br/><br/><br/>',

        description: "Fallschirmjaeger: The Airborne Assault on Fortress Holland May 10 to 14, 1940, simulates the German May, 1940 capture of Rotterdam and The Hague (Den Haag).<br/><br/>In the spring of 1940, the German military machine turned west to convert the Phoney War into a real one. Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.<br/><br/>Fallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.<br/><br/>In the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.<br/><br/>The player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win. Any German player thinking he'll have an easy time, must be reminded his is not Nazi Germany's main effort and that he must make-do on a shoestring.<br/><br/>Fallschirmjaeger is the eighth game in the popular Standard Combat Series by The Gamers. Following last year's smash hit of Drive on Paris, Al Wambold returns to show this under-represented battle in great detail, much of which, from original Dutch records...and, yes, Dutch researchers were used to confirm the accuracy of the map!<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 8 hours<br/>Hex: 0.6 miles / 1 Km<br/>Units: Platoon &amp; Company<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheet (560 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page SCS version 1.6 system rulebook<br/>One 16-page Fallschirmjaeger specific rulebook<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-12 hours<br/><br/>",

This civil war opposes, in a first conflict phase, protestants- otherwise known as Huguenots- to catholics, then royalists to League members after the accession of Henri IV to the throne in 1589.<br/>The art of war during this period of the Renaissance is rapidly changing. The great feudal landlords, steeped in morals, fight alongside mercenaries motivated by sole cupidity. The diversity of the weapons that are used offers great tactical possibilities, based on impact and fire. Gendarmes, cuirassiers, reiters, harquebusiers, lansquenets and Swiss mercenaries confront each other in a merciless fight.<br/>The Fate of Reiters  is a grand tactical game which, for the first time, allows the simulation of five battles of that era :<br/>COGNAT : January 6th, 1568<br/>DORMANS : October 10th, 1575<br/>AUNEAU : November 24th, 1587<br/>VIMORY : October 26th, 1587<br/>METRIEUX (aka VIRE-CULS) December 10th, 1587<br/><br/>This is a classic game system ; &laquo; I go, You go &raquo;, of average complexity, including, during the active player's phase, a sequence of reaction from the passive player, such as fire, counter-charge or tactical backstep. The maps are whith areas from 300 to 500 m by side. A color code allows to easily determine the costs of movements and the line of sight. The scale of the game is one unit for 100 to 500 soldiers or one or two guns. One game turn represents a duration of 20 to 30 minutes. A corps represents either a vanguard or a rearguard, or the main body called battle.<br/>The combats allow to simulate charges &laquo; in wall &raquo;, the merciless shocks between pikemen, the artillery fire and highlight, by a support system, the combination of iron -shock- and fire -shooting. The optional rules- caracoles, orders, lost children, looting- add even more realism to the era's battles. The rules and the five battles offered are based on a thorough bibliography and researches made into books written by contemporary authors, specifically Fran&ccedil;ois de la Noue for the Protestants and Blaise de Montluc for the Catholics, and also on precise topographical plans of each battlefield that is still accessible... Are you ready to put on the Henri de Guise, Duke of Lorraine and fight your enemies the famous German mercenaries? The Fate of Reiters is the second opus of By Shot, Shock and Faith (P3F). This new HEXASIM game offers you this option with an innovating and elegant game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game uses 2 22x34 inch maps with 200 yards to the hex along with 940 counters representing individual regiments and artillery batteries along with all the leaders down to the divisional level.  The map covers quite a bit of the area around Gettysburg giving players plenty of room to maneuver.  While the game is at nearly the same level as SPI&rsquo;s Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game, it does move more quickly due to somewhat more streamlined rules as well as an initiative system that randomizes who&rsquo;s going to move next and how long a turn will last.  There is even a random events chart that occasional allows a player to move and enemy unit or launch a free counter-attack.<br/><br/>From the rulebook:<br/><br/>&ldquo;The sequence of play is move-and-shoot, but initiative rules and a variable number of turns per day keep both players guessing.  The initiative rules help him who helps himself; once you gain an advantage, it&rsquo;s in your best interest to keep the pressure on.  Combat stresses unit morale, but can turn bloody if both units stand and fight.  All-out charges can clear ground fast, but at the cost of much higher casualties.&rdquo;<br/><br/><br/>',

Both the game and series depict the early days of World War III in West Germany. Combat is conducted at the company, battalion, and regiment level, with a map scale of 4 km per hex. The map covers the Fulda Gap and includes the major West German cities of Frankfurt and Mainz.<br/><br/>Fifth Corps uses a collection of mechanics, including &quot;Operations Points&quot; and &quot;Friction Points&quot;, variable length game turns, and Zones of Control to simulate modern battlefield conditions. As with most modern warfare games, Fifth Corps includes rules for airpower, airmobile operations, and nuclear/chemical warfare. The game includes three scenarios: an introductory &quot;Rhein-Main Raid&quot;, a more advanced &quot;The Battle for Fulda&quot;, and the campaign game, &quot;Fifth Corps&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>    The Rhein-Main Raid Scenario: Three days after the next war began, the Soviets had not crossed into the Fulda/Frankfurt area. All Warsaw Pact lines of advance had been to the north and south of Fifth Corp's area of operations.Thus, NATO vacated the area to reinforce other hard hit sectors. NATO was surprised then, when two Soviet motorized rifle divisions entered the Fulda Gap supported by attack helicopters, aiming to seize a NATO nuclear site at Giessen, the Wiesbaden Airfield, and the critical Rhein-Main Airbase... A mobile, confusing engagement ensured, independent of the major battles along the rest of the front.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The Battle for Fulda Scenario: At the outbreak of the next war, few areas were harder hit than the Fulda Gap. Here an entire Soviet Army and various support units, including an airborne regiment, were committed on the first day... Those [NATO support units] that survived were ordered to &quot;contain all enemy breakouts&quot; until the arrival of the 5th Panzer Division.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Fifth Corps Scenario: Following the initial attack by 8th Guards Army, the Soviets sought to seal the fate of NATO in the Fulda/Frankfurt area by committing the 1st Guards Tank Army to the action...

The same distance that planes could cover in a few hours took days for ships and weeks for foot soldiers. Hostile jungles and great oceans combined to make logistics and transport of paramount historical concerns. These and other design puzzles are solvable by only the most gifted designers.<br/><br/>Renowned Japanese wargame designer Tetsuya Nakamura has successfully met these challenges and Multi-Man Publishing is to offer the elegant result - Fire in the Sky. Fire in the Sky has, until now, only been available in Japanese.<br/><br/>With only one map and 180 counters, Fire in the Sky packs years of prior Pacific design attempts and experience into an effort that beautifully distills the essence of the conflict and serves as further proof that great things do indeed come in small packages. Fire in the Sky provides players with the same problems and perspectives faced by the historical combatants, yet does so in a game that can be played in 5 hours or less. The game is ingeniously balanced and so provides not only a look into the minds of the actual commanders, but also a fun, competitive and tense gaming experience.<br/><br/>The game includes glorious 1-inch counters, a clever map that integrates hexes and areas, and rules that cover all of the essential aspects of the Great Pacific War. Oil convoys and troop transports are as vital to victory as the massive Carrier fleets that steam over the vast Pacific. Tetsuya Nakamura&rsquo;s intelligent and ingenious design also offers Western players a fascinating glimpse into the Japanese perspective on the war.<br/><br/>',

        description: 'THIS GAME HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED.<br/><br/>Flintlock is a company-level American Revolution gaming at a scale of c.50 yards per hex and about 50 men per counter/unit.  The system emphasizes the limits of command, training, and discipline, all in the milieu of the very linear style of warfare in the pre-Napoleonic era. In addition, it uses a most unusual set of mechanics for resolving shock combat. Will you have your troops go into close order, or spread out for better fire possibilities? What are the pros and cons of the rifle-armed American militia? Can your dragoon forces exert any influence?<br/><br/>Flintlock is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, but they cover almost every aspect of battle at this micro level. Playing time is less than 2 hours.<br/><br/>The battles chosen highlight small unit tactics in the grueling Southern Campaign, where both sides had ample opportunities to watch, learn and practice, with an emphasis on Formation. Some of the great commanders of the war, from Nathanial Greene and Daniel Morgan to Lord Cornwallis and the infamous, but capable, Banastre Tarleton are in full action.<br/><br/>The Scenario/battles, all (well, most) with armies of one or two thousand men, include:<br/><br/><br/>    Camden (17 August 1780)  Lord Cornwallis stands and confronts a much larger force under Horatio Gates, but the rebel militia disintegrates and Gates&rsquo;s army is routed in a major British victory. <br/><br/><br/><br/>    Cowpens (17 January 1781) Daniel Morgan conducts a masterful, tactical battle, defeating Banastre Tarleton and destroying the dreaded British Legion in one of the major victories of the war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Guilford Courthouse (15 March 1781) Nathanial Greene outnumbers Lord Cornwallis by more than two to one. However, the British take the field but with such heavy losses that, in retrospect, Greene could claim a strategic success.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Hobkirk&rsquo;s Hill (25 April 1781) Nathanial Greene&rsquo;s Marylanders fail to stand against a concerted charge from Lord Rawdon&rsquo;s smaller but better disciplined army. <br/><br/><br/>',

        description: 'A simulation of the battle of Flodden, 1513.<br/><br/>Re-published in Battles magazine #9.<br/><br/><br/>(from the designer:)<br/><br/>The Flowers of The Forest covers the Anglo-Scots battle of Flodden in which an invading Scots army under the charismatic James IV was destroyed in hand-to-hand combat by the Earl of Surrey&rsquo;s force. This was a clash between numbers of weapon-systems. The English had mostly bill and bow, though their light cavalry (the moss troopers) used a small crossbow called a latch. The Scots had changed over to the pike and were well supplied with cannon. I have assumed the Highland formations were not pike armed but used the more traditional sword and axe.           <br/>           <br/>The battle was one of the last with a medieval format of a small number of large &ldquo;battles&rdquo; &ndash; six a side at Flodden. These units manoeuvre on a map of the area around Flodden hill from which the Scots descended. The counters representing the bands of men are stored on Arrays which are displays that resemble a plan view of the unit counter. You will typically put the best bands at the front, and will also consider whether to put bows in the front line or in the rear.           <br/>           <br/>The combat system models the degradation of combat effectiveness as losses and morale reductions take a toll. However, just because the less experienced men at the back of the unit are unhappy does not mean that the unit will break. The key individual captains and &ldquo;Big Men&rdquo; of the front-line units must be defeated. When a unit snaps the entire unit will rout.           <br/>           <br/>The order system models the difficulty of controlling large bodies without radios. It also addresses the great independence (in practice) of Scots nobles over their Sassenach equivalents. The game is not balanced but plays quickly so that each player may have a turn at each side.<br/><br/>',

The playing area is much larger than say Hannibal, there are lots more forces and generals, and there is a much more complicated political control/strategic will system - as well as quite a few other significant elements. While still clean and streamlined for a complicated wargame, this is nontheless more of a serious hobby game than any of the previous entries in the genre.<br/><br/><br/>(Note from Mark Herman:)<br/><br/>The game was reprinted and the latest and final version of the rules has incorporated all of the previous FAQs plus has re-written some of the more troublesome rules sections (rivers). To date, after a grueling three-year on-line tournament, no rules questions of note have been forthcoming. The above write up is mistaken when it states that &quot;For The People&quot; is based on &quot;Hannibal v Rome&quot;, but was my second game in the &quot;We The People&quot; genre that I created. The game dropped my battle card system in lieu of a more traditional combat results table to speed play and increase historical accuracy.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>The 2006 edition, component description above, was recently released. Other than the use of color in the rules and the play aids, the only difference between this and the 2006 edition is I added some variant rules to the rulebook.

More powerful cards may require the roll of a dice and can result in great gains or disastrous engine blow-outs that can put cars out of the race and cannot rejoin the fray until the next race begins.<br/><br/>Play is quick and simple with players required to play one action per turn, carry out its effects and drawing a card to end their turn. Each race will end after the draw deck is exhausted with one final turn taking place. Points are then awarded for positions 1-6 and a leaderboard is recorded.

Both games use the same rules and share many game pieces, but each has a separate full size map.<br/><br/>Sickle Cut: Guderian's Drive to the Channel<br/><br/>This game covers the crucial week in May 1940 when the German army broke the French line on the Meuse and raced to the sea at Abbeville. The game starts on May 13th, the third day of Case Yellow. Six panzer divisions have passed through the Ardennes and are now at the Meuse River. The French and British have raced through Belgium to reach the Dyle Line and cover the Gembloux Gap. The stage is set. Can the Germans cross the Meuse in front of strong opposition? And, if they can, will they be able to break out from the bridgeheads and advance across the map while threatened by Allied reinforcements pouring in from the north and south?<br/><br/>Dynamo: Retreat to Victory<br/><br/>This game covers the British withdrawal to Dunkirk and the evacuation. The game starts on May 24th, the day the British decide that the B.E.F. is in real danger of being cut-off from their supply base and the best option is to head for the coast at Dunkirk. However, many of the German panzer divisions are closer to Dunkirk than the British. Can the British reach the coast before the Germans? Can they hold the Dunkirk perimeter for eight days while they evacuate?<br/><br/><br/>The rules for both games highlight armor, air support, and morale. Special rules include: Allied Heavy Tanks, DeGaulle, Rommel, Hitler's Halt Order, and French Command Paralysis.

Vandenbroucke review - <a target='_blank' href=\"http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt</a>):<br/><br/>France 1944 (Victory Games) is a Mark Herman design.  It's a 130 counter, 1 map game of the breakout and pursuit across France. Units are divisions, I believe.  Components are up to VG's usual high standards.<br/><br/>Complexity is rated as &quot;low,&quot; and solitaire suitability is &quot;medium.&quot;  The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality.  There is a track display that you use during movement/combat.  As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions.  It's easier to play than it is to describe.<br/><br/>For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.<br/><br/>The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).<br/>Chrome rules cover Market-Garden and the Bulge.<br/><br/>",

One player assumes the role of the German high command, the other the French. The German objective is to defeat France, thereby unifying the various German states into a single nation. The French player's objective is, initially, to gain glory for the French Empire; failing that, it is to successfully defend France against a German invasion. Franco-Prussian War uses a new system to simulate the nature of 19th century warfare.

        description: "Friday, the second game in the Friedemann Friese Series: Freitag-Project (Friedemann Friese), is based on the story of Robinson Crusoe and his loyal partner Friday (Freitag). You play as Friday, and when Robinson Crusoe crashes his ship on your island, your peaceful times are disturbed. You must help Robinson to survive the island and prepare him to defeat the pirates that are coming for the island.<br/><br/>Friday is a solitaire deck-building game in which you optimize your deck of fight cards in order to defeat the hazards of the island. During a turn the player will attempt to defeat hazard cards by playing fight cards from their deck. If defeated, a hazard card will become a fight card and is added to the player's deck. If failed, the player will lose life points but also get the opportunity to remove unwanted cards from their fight deck. In the end, the player will use their optimized fight deck to defeat the two pirate ships coming for the island, allowing Robinson Crusoe to escape the island and allowing you to finally have your peace back!<br/><br/>",

        description: "Friedland 1807, is a simulation of The Battle of Friedland (June 14, 1807), a major engagement of the Napoleonic Wars between the armies of the French Empire commanded by Napoleon I and the armies of the Russian Empire led by Count von Bennigsen. Napoleon and the French obtained a decisive victory that routed much of the Russian army, which retreated chaotically over the Alle River by the end of the fighting.<br/><br/>The engagement at Friedland was a strategic necessity after the Battle of Eylau earlier in 1807 had failed to yield a decisive verdict for either side. The battle began when Bennigsen noticed the seemingly isolated corps of Marshal Lannes at the town of Friedland. Bennigsen, who planned only to secure his march northward to Wehlau and never intended to risk an engagement against Napoleon's numerically-superior forces, thought he had a good chance of destroying these isolated French units and ordered his entire army over the Alle River. Lannes held his ground against determined Russian attacks until Napoleon could bring additional forces onto the field. Bennigsen could have recalled the Russian forces, numbering about 50,000&ndash;60,000 men, and retreated across the river before the arrival of Napoleon&rsquo;s entire army but, being in poor health, decided to stay at Friedland and took no measures to protect his exposed and exhausted army. By late afternoon, the French had amassed a force of 80,000 troops on the battlefield. Relying on superior numbers, Napoleon concluded that the moment had come and ordered a massive assault against the Russian left flank. The sustained French attack pushed back the Russian army and pressed them against the river behind. Unable to withstand the pressure, the Russians broke and started escaping across the Alle, where an unknown number of them died from drowning. The Russian army suffered horrific casualties at Friedland&ndash;losing over 40% of its soldiers on the battlefield<br/><br/>Originally published by Decision Games (I) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #151, along with Vittoria.<br/><br/>A page of errata was published in S&amp;T #153.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: approximately 1 hour<br/>Hex: approximately .6km<br/>Units: Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters, approximately 100 per game)<br/>One 28-page combined Vittoria/Friedland/Napoleonic Battles System rules booklet<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-2 Hours<br/><br/>Players will have to provide one 6-sided die<br/><br/>",

On June 22 in Byelorussia, more than a million Soviet soldiers swept against the German Army Group Centre: the Allied counter-offensive was underway and would not stop until it reached Berlin.<br/>From Overlord to Berlin is a strategic wargame that simulates the end of the Second World War in Europe on all fronts: east, west and Italy. One player directs the Axis forces and must resist Allied pressure for as long as possible while the other directs the Soviets and the Western Allies and must wipe out Nazi Germany and its satellites before the end of the game. The simulation begins in June 1944 with the Normandy landings, the fall of Rome in Italy and Operation Bagration in the east. There was still hard fighting ahead including crossing the Rhine and pushing forward into the heart of the Reich, surrounding numerous armies in the Ruhr and reaching the Elbe.<br/>In the east, Hitler&rsquo;s counter-attacks in Hungary and in Poland accomplished nothing against the might of the Russian bear.<br/>At the beginning of January, Russian troops attacked along the Vistula and drove the Germans back to the Oder. Budapest fell in February, and Vienna was captured in April. Finally, the offensive on Berlin began in April and the Reich fell at the beginning of May 1945, putting an end to the Second World War in Europe.<br/><br/>The cardboard pocket includes :<br/>216 die-cut counters (Units : fronts, armies and army corps)<br/>1 Zone map of Europe from France to USSR, 59 x 40 cm<br/>1 rulebook, 2 player aids<br/><br/><br/>French or English Rules and Charts.<br/><br/>',

        description: '&quot;Fulda Gap: The First Battle of the Next War&quot;, is a regimental/brigade level wargame simulation of a possible Warsaw Pact assault into West Germany through the area of relatively open terrain centered around the town of Fulda sometime in the near future. Success would allow the Pact armies to drive a wedge between the NATO forces deployed to the north and south, seize several important logistic centers, and perhaps establish a bridgehead across the Rhine River.<br/><br/>Of all the scenarios for a coming world war, none has received more attention than the possibility of a future NATO-Warsaw Pact confrontation. For 25 years, the armies of East and West have faced one another across a divided Germany, each knowing that it is in this region that the course of any war will be decided.<br/><br/>There are two types of games: the Standard Game and the Advanced Game. Preferably, the Players should become familiar with the Standard Garne first and then increase the level of complexity until they find a rules mix with which they are most comfortable.<br/><br/>The key to the game lies in the combination of a unique combat system and a new untried unit procedure. Basically, each ground combat unit consists of three &quot;steps&quot; and an untried status. As a unit enters combat, its actual strength&mdash; which may be greater or less than its normal face-value &mdash; must be determined. Combat results are expressed in terms of &quot;retreat points&quot; which must be expended either by retreating and/or by taking step losses. Since the owning player controls the path and method of retreat, there is a wide range of possible outcomes from each combat situation.<br/><br/>Fulda Gap Shows the likely impact of a great number of factors on modern warfare. Supply and movement systems stress the importance of roads and autobahns; rules are provided to reflect the importance of divisional integrity, artillery, helicopters, airmobile units, replacements, Soviet doctrine, field fortifications, and disengagement. And players wishing to increase the complexity of the game may use an innovative air system. Extensive rules also cover chemical and nuclear warfare.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 3.88 miles / 6.25 kilometers<br/>Units: Regiment &amp; Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Fulda Gap rulebook<br/>One dual-side printed Turn Record/Reinforcement Track<br/>Two dual-side printed Charts &amp; Tables folder (4 pages, Combat, Terrain tables, etc)<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>',

How many and all is determined by the specific card. <br/>Combat is resolved by comparing combat strengths of the units and drawing cards from that same deck. Whenever a joker is drawn, the turn is over, the deck is reshuffled and a new turn begins.<br/><br/>Goal of the game is to get the French units off the north side of the map (breaking through Allied lines at Waterloo) while the Allies win by preventing that.<br/><br/>',

It is the first in the series to cover the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in World War II.<br/><br/>The German breakthrough at Sedan opened the way for Guderian&rsquo;s dash to the English Channel. What is not commonly known is that this advance proceeded at a pace which the German General Staff thought to be too aggressive, if not rash. It is not an understatement to say that had the French significantly threatened the Sedan bridgehead, the 1940 campaign could have developed quite differently. The French lost their best opportunity to do just that at the village of Stonne. In GD&rsquo;40, players have the chance to change history. A successful French player may cause OKW to put the brakes on Guderian&rsquo;s advance, which could give the French army time to react to the surprise German blow at Sedan. Failure will allow history to take its course&mdash;one of the most decisive victories of modern time. GD&rsquo;40 is the first in a series of TCS games which will portray the Grossdeutschland throughout the war&mdash;from an infantry regiment in 1940 to a Panzer Corps in 1945.

For reasons still unknown, right before the attack the German 9th Army ordered three battalions the GD Division to move to the Luchessa Valley as OKH reserve, thus backing up the weak 216th Grenadier Regiment.

The Soviets begin with seemingly overwhelming force, while the Germans trade space for time and attempt to rush reinforcements to the front to plug inevitable gaps.

        description: "For those of you who can&rsquo;t stand someone who wins all the time, here is an opportunity to game one of Julius Caesar&rsquo;s rare losses. The Battle of Gergovia was Caesar's failed attempt to wipe out the threat of a large Gallic uprising by isolating and defeating a gathering of the Arverni, plus several other Gallic contingents, under their new chieftain, Vercingetorix.<br/><br/>The Arverni had taken a defensive position in the hill fortress oppidum of Gergovia, a position somewhat similar to (but much smaller than) that that they would take at Alesia but, given the surrounding terrain, a bit more difficult to take.<br/><br/>In a series of short battles that took place mostly below the walls of the oppidum, and probably helped by a topless show from the Gergovian women (really!!), the Gauls managed to drive off the Romans, inflicting on Caesar his only serious loss in his 8 year campaign.<br/><br/>The Gergovia module comes with its own map but uses, mostly, counters from Caesar: Conquest of Gaul, along with a few extra tribesmen counters. It also uses the rules for C/CoG (preferably the 2nd edition (2006), but the original version will work just fine).<br/><br/>And while the hilltop oppidum of Gergovia is fortified, Gergovia is not a siege assault (for the most part), but a rather disconnected series of attacks, feints and mistakes. The terrain is not overly conducive to linear combat, the approach to Gergovia being fairly steep and somewhat rocky, but Caesar, Roman that he is, has already built two camps and a sunken trench for easy movement. Gergovia is a tough game for either side, as the options and possible strategies are multiple.<br/><br/>Designed by GBoH&rsquo;s own Caesar (Julius, not Sid), Richard Berg and Developed by his House Labienus, Al Ray, Gergovia contains one full map, one small sheet of counters, and all rules needed for the battle (as a scenario for Caesar: Conquest of Gaul).<br/><br/>(from the GMT Website)<br/><br/>",

        description: "(from GMT web site :)<br/><br/>Glory III is the third game in GMT's popular American Civil War series, Glory. This series presents a brigade-level system that highlights ease and speed of play combined with solid historical insight. Glory III follows the success of Glory II: Across the Rappahannock, and presents a polished system with ease of play, with two combat-intensive one-map battles. And it is still a game that can be played, and played well, by solitaire gamers.<br/><br/>Glory III features GMT's unique chit activation mechanic, which provides a great deal of play tension, as the commanders never quite know what is going to happen next. However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun. Both battles have special command problems and some new and interesting mechanics to allow the players to play within the framework of those conditions.<br/><br/>Antietam, one of the major battles of the war, makes great use of the Glory activation system, linking the Union/McClellan command problems directly to its use. But it still allows the player to make choices, choices different from those Little Mac made, perhaps changing the course of the battle.<br/><br/>Cedar Creek is a great momentum battle, with an initial, probably highly effective Confederate surprise attack followed by the return of General Phil Sheridan to the battlefield, the arrival of George Custer's repeater-armed cavalry, and, hopefully for the Union Player, enough of a counter-attack to snatch victory from Jubal Early's rapidly munching jaws. Has Jubal bitten off more than he can chew?

This series features battles recreated at the Brigade level with each game in the series featuring 2 battles from the Civil War.

This results in players unsure of when or if a certain field commander will carry out your orders. The game system is designed for playability over bookkeeping. The main rules are only 12 pages long.  Scenarios run from 2 hours for Burnside's late afternoon attack at Antietam, up to 6 hours for Cedar Creek and up to 12 hours for the full battle of Antietam (if it needs to go the distance for a decision).<br/><br/>",

Rapid fire cannons and machine guns usher in a new and deadlier form of warfare. The major powers had prepared for years, building up massive armies and navies. It was supposed to end quickly. War was now too expensive, too deadly. But they would fight on to the death.<br/><br/>The War begins with sweeping invasions. Great armies marching to the largest battles yet seen. Murderous fire produces unimaginable casualties. Exhausted, they dig in. The Armies develop Siege Howitzers, Poison Gas, Tanks, and Combat Aircraft. New tactics attempt to overcome the deadlock of trench warfare. Mass Tank Attacks, Storm Troopers, Drumfire Barrages. The war is on multiple fronts. Belgium, France, Italy, Austria, Serbia, Greece, Turkey, Poland, Russia, Romania, Palestine, Mesopotamia. The conflict is much broader than just the battlefields. Factories must be supplied and people fed. Produce the guns, shells and bullets the armies need, or face disaster.<br/><br/>The Grand Campaign combines all of the Der Weltkrieg series titles (not a stand alone product). Link all of the campaigns together to simulate the entire war from start to finish.

        description: "&quot;Gringo! The Mexican War 1846-1848&quot; is a Post Napoleonic era wargame depicting five battles of &quot;The Mexican War&quot;. For the battles in Gringo!, both sides run the gamut from mountain assaults to street-fighting, allowing wargamers to see some of the differences between ACW-era tactics and those of the Napoleonic era. The battles included are:<br/><br/><br/>    Buena Vista, the classic battle of the war, with Zach Taylor's decimated army making a valiant stand against Santa Anna and a force three times Taylor's. <br/>    Monterey, with the North Americans launching a three-pronged assault against, into, and through the beautiful city of Monterey, complete with huge fortifications, high peaks, bull rings, cathedrals filled with ammunition, even a telegraph system. <br/>    Cerro Gordo, Scott's first meeting with Santa Anna, on the dangerous mountain roads leading towards the heart of Mexico. <br/>    El Molino del Rey, where Santa Anna makes a last, well-entrenched stand outside Mexico City. Will that Mexican cavalry division ever move? <br/>    Chapultepec, a mini-battle, in which the gringos have to scale the precipitous heights of this immense fortress guarding the roads into the Mexican capital. &quot;Stonewall&quot; (pre-nickname) Jackson, hidden mines, wall-scaling, and those courageous Mexican pre-teen cadets. <br/><br/><br/>The wargame rules are simplier (GBACW v4.3) with reduced command rules (for the smaller armies); they also include extensive rules for street-fighting and the square formation. The game includes some of the most colorful characters in military history: General Zachary Taylor &amp; inept division leaders Twiggs &amp; Pillow for the Americans; head throwing General Pedro Ampudia and Generalissimo Antonio de Santa Anna.<br/><br/>Gringo! is easily the most playable, colorful and challenging of the GBACW series wargames to date. 2 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps (1-backprinted), 4 countersheets, plus the usual rules and charts.<br/><br/>Time Scale: 60 minutes per game turn<br/>Map Scale: between 45-125 yards per hex<br/>Unit Scale: Each Strength Point = 50 men<br/>Players: 1-6<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Battle of Churubusco<br/>    Battles with the Gringos, Mexico 1846-62<br/><br/><br/>",

        description: "Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #220.<br/><br/>Group of Soviet Forces Germany features a simulation of a hypothetical Soviet invasion of Germany in the late 1970's. It is a two-player alternative history game intended to examine what could've happened during the first month of fighting had the Soviets opted to invade Germany during the Cold War.  An assumption is made that the invasion would've been executed without lengthy preparation or forewarning.<br/><br/>This game is an update and revision of SPI's 1973 release, &quot;NATO: Operational Combat in Europe in the 1970s&quot;. Its time and space scales have been preserved, but the map has been improved by reflecting a more in depth terrain analysis. The system has been updated and the orders of battle are more fully developed. Air warfare has been added, at least as an abstract, and tactical nukes have been taken away except as possible game enders.<br/><br/>The orders of battle for both sides are based on open-source documents that have become available since the parent game was first published. The system, though more complex than that of the original game, still comes in toward the lower end of today's complexity scale. Experienced gamers can expect to be blasting away within 90 minutes or so of first opening the box.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The Soviet units of maneuver are divisions, as are most NATO units, along with a few brigades and regiments. Each full game turn represents two days.<br/><br/>The game map illustrates the militarily significant terrain found in the western portion of Germany and its environs in the late 1970s. There are 280 unit counters in the game, most of which represent combat formations. Others are also provided as informational markers and memory aids.<br/><br/><br/>",

        description: "Guadalajara, portrays the operations launched by the Italian CTV (Corpo Truppe Volontarie&mdash;Corps of Volunteer Troops) towards Guadalajara with the ultimate objective of taking Madrid and putting a rapid end to the Spanish Civil War. The unexpected and dogged resistance of the Republican Army, which was fully involved in a deep reorganization, caused the failure of this offensive, forcing the Nationalists to give up trying to storm the capital and making them take the long road by capturing the whole country before being able to declare themselves victorious.<br/><br/>After the failure of Franco's Nationalist troops to surround and conquer Madrid during the first months of the Spanish Civil War, Spain looked doomed to a long war of attrition.  During this gloomy period, a new force made its appearance -- the motorized Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie (CTV).  Lavishly equipped and overconfident after its first successful performance in the fall of Malaga, the Italians thought they could quickly and easily end the war.  Spain was not Abyssinia, however, and Madrid was not Malaga.  The new People's Republican Army was no longer the rag-tag mix of militia units that had fought the Nationalists only a few months before.  The Italians were repulsed after a fierce campaign fought under very tough conditions.  Madrid was once again saved for the Republicans, and two more years of war would ensue.<br/><br/>Special rules regarding tanks, anti-tank defenses, flamethrowers, truck transports, traffic jams, morale, and panic will allow you to recreate the Italian offensive.  Will you succeed where your historical counterparts failed?  Will you break the Republican lines?  Will your volunteers panic as they did in 1937?  Prepare to fight what Ernest Hemingway considered one of the most decisive battles in military history.<br/><br/>Four scenarios cover the full campaign, the Italian offensive, the Nationalist &quot;side-offensive&quot;, and the Republican counteroffensive which broke the spine of the Italian assault.<br/><br/>Guadalajara is the twelfth game in the Standard Combat Series (SCS) from series from Multi-Man Publishing.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1-2 days<br/>Hex: .6 mile / 1 kilometers<br/>Units: Company to Battalion<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 32&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page Standard Combat Series rules booklet, Version 1.7<br/>One 16-page Guadalajara rules booklet<br/>One Player Aid card<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-Low<br/>Players: 2-3 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-8<br/><br/>",

        description: "Against the Odds magazine #23<br/><br/>Americans seldom notice the enormous changes that the Napoleonic Wars caused to the Western Hemisphere...things far larger and with much greater effects than our own War of 1812.<br/><br/>The Louisiana Purchase really started it, as Napoleon sold Jefferson a large block of land that really &quot;belonged&quot; to Spain. In shifting their forces to try and limit American expansion, the Spanish-loyal authorities opened the door to losing the remainder of two continents. Guerra a Muerte depicts the 14 year struggle that saw Spain's possessions in the hemisphere change from &quot;almost everything not U.S.&quot; to &quot;Cuba and Hispanola.&quot;<br/><br/>As in the American Revolution, the local population could be divided into &quot;patriots/revolutionaries&quot; on one side, &quot;loyalists/Royalists&quot; on the other, and a huge middle block of those who wished to stay out of battle--over which both sides exerted tremendous pressure, making these episodes as bitter as a period in history. The game title means, &quot;War to the Death,&quot; and comes from a proclamation Simon Bolivar made to all Spaniards in Venezuela--&quot;support us or else.&quot;<br/><br/>Warfare took place from the remote northern border with America to the tip of the continent now shared by Chile and Argentina. Progress ebbed and flowed, with territories changing hands several times and the intensity and size of battles slowly escalating.<br/><br/>The overall war is a fascinating struggle of varied elements, from Spanish and &quot;Royalist&quot; troops to formed patriot units, militias, armed mobs, Indians, and mercenaries. Actions include slave revolts, naval assaults, guerilla war, battles with a hostile environment, and the interplay of politics with economics...all depicted and intermeshed to affect overall play as they affected real events. The game offers a map from &quot;New Spain&quot; to &quot;Rio de la Plata,&quot; with area movement, one-year turns, and 280 half-inch counters.<br/><br/>Guerra a Muerte offers a chance to understand a hardly-heard-of period of Western history, the effects of which are still with us today.<br/><br/>A playaid sheet with additional optional rules are organized into one sheet and included on issue #27.<br/><br/>",

In his brief career, he catapulted Sweden to the forefront of European power politics. This volume sets it focus on the rise and climax of Gustav Adolf's military system.<br/><br/>The series began with the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War, then covered the Swedish army after Gustav Adolf in Sweden Fights On, then looked at the rise of the French in the Thirty Years War in Under the Lily Banners. In this volume the Swedish face the tough Polish cavalry, lance equipped winged Husars and Cossacks. The Swedish-style brigades also take on the unbeaten Tilly at the head of the allied Catholic League and Imperial armies. Finally, Wallenstein, with a resurgent Imperial army, mastered the art of drawing out the Swedes to attack on ground of his choosing.<br/><br/>In each battle included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms, armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player who can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions or brigades, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, Cavalry Pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The battles included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms are:<br/><br/>Dirschau 1627 - The Prussian campaign that started in 1626, Gustav Adolf had finally brought the Poles to the field and defeated them in battle at Gniew a month before, skillfully using terrain to offset the powerful Polish Hussars. Again the King faced the Polish General Koniecpolski and sought to the same again.<br/><br/>Breitenfeld 1631 - The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War<br/><br/>Alte Veste 1632 - The late summer saw the Swedish besieged by Wallenstein at N&uuml;rnberg.<br/><br/>L&uuml;tzen 1632 - Southeast of Leipzig the Swedes caught up to the Imperial main body. Wallenstein's army had detached two corps and was serious danger. He fortified a position at L&uuml;tzen. King Gustav Adolf's final battle.<br/><br/>Honigfelde / Trzciano 1629 - &quot;I've never had a hotter bath!&quot; exclaimed Gustav II Adolf upon his return. Very nearly captured while trying to extricate his army from a Polish and Imperial trap, this great cavalry battle showed the Poles were to be treated with respect. Rheingraf Otto Ludwig's German cavalry attacked the advancing Poles and was drawn into a pincer. Gustav Adolf rushed forward to save the impetuous Rheingraf. Koniecpolski showed his cunning. The Imperial contingent joined the fray and sent the Swedes falling back. The Imperial commander, von Arnim, would take the field with Gustav Adolf at Breitenfeld two years later.<br/><br/>Components: <br/>3 Full-color countersheets<br/>Two 22&quot;x34&quot; back-printed maps <br/>Rulebook <br/>Scenario/Playbook<br/>2 11x17&quot; Player Aid Cards<br/><br/>",

When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.<br/><br/>The 20th Anniversary of the release of this classic game will see the release of a new, revised, updated, and expanded game entitled Hannibal & Hamilcar. This new edition reimplements the Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage game, and includes the Hamilcar: First Punic War expansion. See the Hannibal & Hamilcar entry for details of the 2017 revamped game.<br/><br/>",

        description: '&quot;Hannibal: The Second Punic War&quot;, is a two-player wargame that covers the conflict between Carthage and Rome, during the period of 218 to 195 B.C..<br/><br/>The Carthaginians, under the military leadership of their general, Hannibal, marched into Italy and won several battle. The Romans, meanwhile, built up their strength and eventually counterattacked, leading to a Roman victory.<br/><br/>The game shows the difference between the two military systems, the Carthaginians start out with better leaders, but the Romans have a greater population to build armies from. The game map represents countries of the Western Mediterranean area in which the war actually took place.<br/><br/>Each turn represents one year. During each turn, there is in sequence a Diplomacy Segment, a Carthaginian turn and a Roman turn. Basic and Advanced Rules allow customization of gameplay. Strategic movement is performed on the map. When armies engage each other, they are transferred to a Battleboard, which allows for army field positioning and tactical combat.  Amphibious Assaults, Recruiting and Promotion on the March, Siege Assault, Naval Combat and Interception, and Neutrals are all part of the basic rules. Tactical Superiority, Roman Battlefield relief, Supply and Attrition, Land Units in naval combat, Limited Intelligence, Blockade, and special rules for Syracuse are Advanced rules.<br/><br/>Originally published by Decision Games (I) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #141.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1 year<br/>Map: Point-to-Point<br/>Units: 1,500 to 10,000 men, 25-50 warships<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 20-page Hannibal: The Second Punic War rules booklet<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3-5 Hours<br/><br/>Players will have to provide one 6-sided die<br/><br/>',

Players receive points for destroying enemy brigades as well as several geographical features of the battlefield such as Little Round Top, Devils Den, the Peach Orchard, the infamous wheat field and the angle. Silhouette style counters depicting union and rebel troops in the traditional blue and gray colors add to the feel of the ebb and flow of the fighting. The map is quite small but is more than useful and never seems to get crowded.<br/><br/>One huge bonus... the game can be played solitaire, as rules have been added so a solo player can take control of the advancing confederates, whilst the game mechanics take care of the defending union brigades.<br/><br/>One wishes that more &quot;smaller&rdquo; scale and sized games had been produced over the years, I recommend this game to all ACW war gamers and anyone who likes solo war gaming.<br/><br/>Nominee for the 1989 Charles S.

The game is quick (3-6 hours) and clean (map using area movement). Hearts and Minds uses most major events of the period, including proposed events such as the Macnamara Line which was never actually built. Although nominally a combat game, the mechanisms actually revolve around both sides occupying South Vietnamese provinces for propaganda purposes. The heart of the game is political influence. There is little doubt that the Allied player will eventually withdraw his American boys from the quagmire, but the question is, how quickly and in what numbers?<br/><br/>Hearts and Minds contains 80 cards, counters to represent the American army, the ARVN army, the NVA army, VC units of varying hidden strength, the Cambodian army, the Laotian army and a small contingent of international allies. Turn markers, withdrawal markers, reduced movement markers as well CAS (Close Air Support), communist Air Suppression and artillery are also included. More rules cover Air Cavalry, Naval support, Riverine interdiction, and bombers. Untried troops are a liability in the game; Veteran troops are a necessity. Ultimately, the Communist player must deal the American such a crushing public relations disaster that he will abandon his Southeast Asian allies before the momentum of those allies stalemates the irreversible infiltration of South Vietnam.<br/><br/>',

In September of 1944, three Allied airborne divisions dropped up to 60 miles behind German lines in Holland to seize and hold a series of roads and bridges until British ground forces could break through the front lines to link up with the paratroopers- to create an open road to the heart of the Third Reich.  Until now, the tragic yet fascinating story of Market-Garden has not been simulated on a level that allows an appreciation of the entire campaign, without bogging down in endless detail.  In Hell's Highway, players trace the leaden movement of XXX Corps along its jammed highway, drop the gallant paratroopers on the key bridges, and launch the unexpected panzers against the grim Arnhem defenders.

This game covers all the action of the period using a unique card-driven game system that models both the political and religious conflicts of the period on a single point-to-point map.<br/><br/>There are six main powers in the game, each with a unique path to victory:<br/><br/>    The Ottomans<br/>    The Habsburgs<br/>    The English<br/>    The French<br/>    The Papacy<br/>    The Protestants<br/><br/><br/>Here I Stand is the first card-driven game to prominently feature secret deal-making. A true six-sided diplomatic struggle, the game places a heavy emphasis on successful alliance-building through negotiations that occur away from the table during the pre-turn Diplomacy Phase.

Each turn, a player moves one penguin in a straight line over hex-shaped ice tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them.

        description: "(from Decision Games website:)<br/><br/>Highway to the Reich is a tactical simulation of the largest airborne operation in history. Over 35,000 men belonging to 1st Allied Airborne Army dropped from the skies of Holland. Their objective: capture and hold a highway. The result: a salient into German territory that lacked only the last objective, and was thus a tragic defeat.<br/><br/>The 2,000-plus counters detail Brereton's Airborne Corps of three divisions, the units of Brian Horrocks's 30th Corps, and Model's scattered and dishevelled forces at company level for infantry; battery level for artillery, anti -tank and anti-air; and troop level for tank and armored cars.<br/><br/>The four maps cover the area from the front along the Meuse-Escaut Canal to the land, nearly 200 hexes away, surrounding the Arnhem Highway Bridge. Each map is positioned to cover the operational area of one airborne division. That allows one-division scenarios.<br/><br/>The system focuses on the interaction of two variables: fire power and morale. The structure of the game turns is simple, with each player turn divided into a Command Communications Phase and a Maneuver Phase. All the activities of each formation are completed before those of another are begun. Attacks proceed with a preliminary barrage, fire attack by maneuver companies, and then close action with tanks or assault troops. All activities involve comparisons of involved units' capabilities. Those variables create the framework within which the players operate.<br/><br/>Optional rules focus on hidden movement and multi-player variations, as well as giving the Allied player the opportunity to execute his own operational plan.<br/><br/>",

Since every Player controls Romans as well as Barbarians you will get all kinds of situations like Romans vs. Barbarians, Romans fighting among themselves, or Barbarians fighting other Barbarians.<br/>The Emperor for each Roman Faction changes every Game Turn as well as the Barbarian Peoples that the Players control.<br/>With its easy to learn rules - players who are familiar with &quot;Hispania&quot;, &quot;Britannia&quot; or &quot;History of the World&quot; will find some similarities and some new features - and the constantly changing Barbarians, &quot;The History of the Roman Empire&quot; can be great fun.<br/><br/>The Players will have to decide how to use their Roman Legions as well as how to use the armies of their Barbarians and of course where to plan new Cities and Forts (for the Roman Factions).<br/>Since it is worth many more Victory Points to control all areas of one color, soon everyone will try to establish his own small empire (and of course to disturb the others), until the more powerful Barbarians like the Goths or the Huns arrive and threaten to take control of the map.<br/><br/>Each turn the Roman Factions spend some of their Victory Points on new Legions and/or Forts or Fortresses. The Barbarians do not use their Victory Points for recruiting Units but rather &quot;mobilize&quot; up to a certain number of Armies (how many units depends on the Barbarian People).<br/>Every game will present you with new situations since the Players will work on and change their strategies and the 45 random cards will influence every game in a unique way.<br/>At the end of the seventh turn, the players total their victory points and determine the winner.<br/><br/>Will the Roman Empire rise to Glory or will it be crushed by the overwhelming Barbarians?<br/><br/>It's up to YOU&hellip;<br/><br/>",

The great choices that faced each government must also be solved. Questions relating to war direction, production priorities, and research allotments become as important to ultimate victory as when to invade Russia or how much force will be needed to overrun France.

        description: "Subtitle: Six Bridges: The Battle of Pittsburgh, October 1, 1863<br/><br/>It was early September 1863 &amp; Gen. Robert E. Lee was perplexed. He'd smashed the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, then chewed up its remnants as it tried to defend Washington, captured that city, though much of it was burned in the process, and came within card throw of bagging both Lincoln &amp; Grant. But instead of gaining the Confederacy the ultimate victory Lee had sought when he began that risky campaign, the fall of Washington served only to radicalize &amp; galvanize the North.<br/><br/>Lincoln has sailed to Boston to set up a new US capital. He declined the 'offer of mediation toward peace' extended by the ambassadors of Great Britain &amp; France. London &amp; Paris soon recognized the Confederacy - the government of which now housed in the charred &amp; bullet-pocked city of Washington, DD (that is, the District of Dixie!), and announced they would join the war to secure its independence.<br/><br/>But then, before Union &amp; Anglo-French naval vessels even exchanged their first broadsides, the Prussians made their move, declaring for the Union &amp; launching strong attacks into France &amp; Bavaria. That led the Austrians; ever jealous and fearful their Prussian cousins were aiming to supplant their primacy in the Germanic world, to throw in with France. Then the Czar mobilized his millions of newly emancipated serfs, creating the largest single army yet seen on the planet, leading them in an attack on Vienna.<br/><br/>With the CSA, Britain, France &amp; Austria on one side, fighting the USA, Prussia &amp; Russia on the other, World War I began in August 1863. &quot;Home Before the Leaves Fall&quot; was the cry heard across the northern hemisphere.<br/><br/>Lee convinced Jefferson Davis to reinforce him by shifting troops fromBragg;'s Army to create a 4th Corps for the Army of Northern Virginia. Comprised of Tennessee men &amp; recruits from the new Confederate state of Maryland, Gen. Pat Cleburne was picked to run it. Lee intended to use the new Corps as a screen for his next offensive.<br/><br/>With the fall of Vicksburg, &amp; Port Hudson, Lee reasoned Gen.Sherman would move east to relieve the Union's fortunes. If he could intercept Sherman &amp; destroy his army before it linked with Grant's, the war would surely end. Scanning his maps, Lee determined Pittsburgh was the key. If he controlled it, he would sever the only east / west rail line left to the Union. It was also the perfect place to meet the British (actually Anglo-Canadian) Expeditionary Force forming in Canada for a crossing of Lake Erie.<br/><br/>Lee sent an outline of his plan to the Commander of the BEF, Sir Patrick Macdougall, who was highly receptive, sending a reply in which he promised to rendezvous with lee at Pittsburgh on or around October 1.<br/><br/>Until 14 September, Grant &amp; Lincoln had assumed Lee's next move would be in the Northeast. On that day a minister of the Canadian government, a strong abolition man, defected with a copy of the Confederate general's letter. After much debate, the two US war leaders convinced themselves the document was authentic &amp; set about to counter Lee's plan. The 3rd Corps was left to defend the Susquehanna River line, in case they were wrong, and a telegram was sent to Sherman instructing him to move to Pittsburgh as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>By the 17th, when Lee began marching northeast towards Pittsburgh, Grant had already stolen a day's march on him. The question became who would get to the city first to meet Lee &amp; Grant: the BEF, shuttling across Lake Erie then marching down the western borderlands of Pennsylvania, or Sherman, coming up the Ohio valley. Neither Grant nor Lee knew who would be reinforced first or exactly when, but both understood there would be a savage fight for Pittsburgh. It would go into southern history books as the Battle of Six Bridges.<br/><br/>As noted, it is an alternative history of American Civil War, prequel of this is Wahoo! -- The Battle of Washington, July 8, 1863.<br/><br/>",

These components represent the participants and locations of two ACW Confederate Cavalry engagements that involved the southern raider, General Nathan Bedford Forrest. The two battles, Brice's Crossroads and Tupelo, resulted from U.S. General William T. Sherman's campaign to remove Forrest as a threat to his flank and supply lines. Before the Union Army marched on Atlanta, Elements of Sherman's Army pursued Forrest, and others, into Mississippi and engaged his cavalry twice before its destruction at Tupelo.<br/><br/>All game-turns represent approximately 1 hour real time, and each Strength Point is the equivalent of 50 men or 1 gun. In Brice's Crossroads, the map scale is 115 yards per hex. In Tupelo the scale is 160 yards per hex.<br/><br/>This game is an excellent example of the, ever evolving, TSS/GBACW game system. New rules for Cavalry and a modified sequence of play are just couple of the many refinements. I've always wanted to adapt these refinements to the earlier TSS Cavalry game Rebel Sabers: Civil War Cavalry Battles by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.).

Observers report that the balloon plummeted out of a cloudy sky into thick woods close to Airesborne Castle, killing both the duke and his son. The duke's brother, Drafton, succeeds to the title. &quot;Drafty,&quot; as he is popularly known, is in poor health and remains secluded at Airesborne Castle.<br/>Lofton received much attention several months ago when he presented a proposal to Parliament to defend the coast of England with an army of armored balloons, &quot;constantly aloft, constantly alert, and threatening death to all intruders.&quot; Though the proposal was easily defeated, Lofton persisted in the study and development of the balloons, which he stated are &quot;critical to the well-being and security of our nation.&quot;<br/>It was one such balloon that the duke and his son were testing on the morning of the crash. A spokesman for the Aires family declared, &quot;The duke had developed an advanced version of his armored balloon and was in the process of testing it when the accident occurred.

        description: 'Hungarian Rhapsody depicts the Soviet drive into Hungary which led the Red Army into the Vienna  basin. Rumania\'s defection in August 1944 allowed the Soviets to outflank well defended Axis positions in the Carpathian Mountains through the South. In the process, the German 6th Army was almost destroyed, losing most of its heavy equipment (which explains the relative weakness of the German artillery at the start  of  the campaign). The game begins on 5 October 1944 with the 2nd Ukrainian Front and the 4th Ukrainian Front launching an offensive to isolate the German 8th Army which is still defending an area off-map to the East in the Carpathian Mountains.<br/><br/>Hungarian Rhapsody allows players to play the two  major Soviet offensives and several smaller scenarios covering the German counter offensives.<br/><br/>Hungarian Rhapsody is the next game in the award winning Operational Combat System (OCS #18). Players control units ranging from battalions through divisions, making key decisions on the use, objectives, and means of war.

        description: "Shogun / Samurai Swords is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It was later rereleased by HAH under the name Ikusa. The game focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.<br/><br/>In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.<br/><br/>The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game.<br/><br/>",

The six powers (USA, Europe, Russia, China, India, and Brazil) develop their industrial basis and build up armies and fleets.  They fight over control of neutral land and sea areas in order to become the most powerful nation worldwide.<br/><br/>In this game it is not the players who take turns, but the six powers, one after another.  The players are just internationally operating investors who act in the background.  By giving money to the six powers, which all have their own treasuries, the players influence the politics.  The biggest investor in each nation gains control of that nation's government and decides what the nation will do.  As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time.  As investors, players should not get too attached to their preferred nation, but rather focus on where their investments have the best rates of return.  Essentially the game is about money, and not about military domination!<br/><br/>Imperial 2030 was released at Essen 2009 by PD-Games and Rio Grande Games. Compared to &quot;Imperial&quot; there will be some new features:<br/>- new wooden bits<br/>- the Swiss Bank <br/>- a new 30 million bond to invest in<br/>- more neutral territory, generating higher taxation<br/>- fewer home provinces<br/>- control of canals (Panama and Suez).<br/><br/>For those who already owned Imperial, there was the opportunity to get only the new map and bonds at Essen '09, as it can be played with the old wooden bits as well.<br/><br/>",

Designed by John Gorkowski, this series enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulsed-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspire historically accurate play without forcing decisions.<br/><br/>In the Trenches: Through Mud and Blood includes seven operations. &quot;Balkan Brawl&quot; takes place in Macedonia, &quot;Schneiders at Juvincourt&quot; pits French tanks against German infantry, &quot;The Lost Battalion&quot; and &quot;Go to Hell!&quot; depict the battles of the 308th US Infantry Battalion in the Charlevaux Valley, &quot;War of Machines&quot; and &quot;Combined Arms&quot; involves British and German tanks on the Western Front, and &quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot; depicts trench fighting between the British and Germans during the last German offensive of the First World War.<br/><br/>Included in In the Trenches: Through Mud and Blood are five 11.5&quot; x 8&quot; maps, 264 die-cut counters, one rulebook, guides for all seven operations, one reference card, and two D6s.<br/><br/>(source: Grenier Games website)<br/><br/><br/>Maps:<br/><br/>Maps are single-sheet 11.5&quot; x 8&quot; and printed on stiff, glossy cardstock.<br/><br/>The featured five maps are:<br/>&quot;Hill 06&quot; covers a piece of territory near Lake Doiran in Macedonia<br/>&quot;Juvincourt&quot; features the village of that name, and the nearby countryside <br/>&quot;Charlevaux Valley&quot; contains the battlefield of the Lost Battalion, <br/>&quot;Open Ground&quot; leaves a clean playing field for the tanks (and perfect for make-your-own battles),<br/>&quot;Racecourse Redoubt&quot; features a network of trenches on the Western Front.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>Balkan Brawl<br/>To break the stalemate at Salonika, the Allies planned to strike the Bulgarian centre. As part of a larger effort, the 11th Worcestershire Battalion, 78th Brigade, 22nd Division aimed to capture &quot;06&quot;, a strongpoint of the Bulgarian 9th Division on &quot;Pip Ridge&quot; just east of Lake Doiran in Macedonia. At 2145, after days of intermittent shelling, the preparatory barrage ceased and the officers' shrill whistles rose from the din. British troops filtered down into Hana Ravine just before bounding up the slope to &quot;06&quot;.<br/><br/>Schneiders at Juvincourt<br/>As part of the Nivelle Offensive, Commandant Louis Bossut led five &quot;Special Artillery&quot; groups of 16 Schneider tanks each into German lines near Berry-Au-Bac at 0600. Groupment Bossut crossed the first German trench line with infantry against light resistance. But nagging artillery fires and mechanical failures began to nibble away at his force. Four kilometers later, Bossut swung northward to cross the second German trench line with his 60 remaining tanks and the 151st Infantry Regiment. After crossing around 0900, Bossut split his force sending two groups north toward Juvincourt, two more west toward Mauchamp and one south toward the Aisne.<br/><br/>The Lost Battalion<br/>On 2 October 1918, elements of the U.S. 77th &quot;Liberty&quot; Division from New York attacked north into the Argonne Forest. Major Whittlesey's force of two battalions from the 308th Infantry and two platoons of the 306th Machine Gun outpaced neighboring American units by penetrating a full kilometer into German lines. At dusk, Whittlesey's men dug in along the north slope of a valley between a road at the top and a stream at the bottom. Company K of the 307th joined the following morning. Seeing that this force had outpaced its flank protection, the Germans slowly encircled the &quot;Lost Battalion&quot;, in a pocket about 500 meters east of Moulin de Charlevaux. At 3 PM on October 3, the Germans launched their first attack.<br/><br/>Go to Hell!<br/>After 5 days of siege, the Lost Battalion was out of bandages, drinking from the Charlevaux Brook, and coughing on the stench of the rotting corpses that surrounded them. the Germans sent an American POW back to his comrades with a letter offering to accept an American surrender. According to legend, Major Whittlesey spat back, &quot;Go to Hell!&quot;<br/><br/>Kaiserschlacht<br/>The Kaiser's Battle began at 0435 with an unprecedented artillery bombardment of gas, smoke and high explosive rounds. About 9,955 tubes of all sizes rained over 1,100,000 shells across 40 miles of frontage. At 0940 the firing stopped; Stosstruppen immediately sprang from their shell holes as German regulars emerged from trenches close behind. Near Grugies not far from St. Quentin, Germany's 238th division slammed into Britain's 36th Ulster amid dense fog and lingering smoke. The recently arrived Ulster men had just taken over French positions and had yet to fully implement the new defense in depth doctrine.<br/><br/>War of Machines<br/>During the Second Battle of Cambrai, British troops of Byng's third Army broke through the Hindenburg Line to &quot;the green fields beyond.&quot; Leading the way, tanks of the 12th Battalion helped XVII Corps capture Niergnies. Just east of the town, Captain Roe's tank, L16, paused at Mont Neuve Farm. there he spotted four MIVs coming his way from the east. C Company - he thought.<br/><br/>Combined Arms<br/>After Ludendorff's Operation Georgette bogged down in the north, he made a thrust for Amiens. At dawn on April 24th, thirteen German tanks lumbered forward over a gloomy moonscape with infantry close behind. After plowing through Britain's 173rd Brigade, they covered 4,000 yards to reach the Cachy Switch Line, a stitch work arrangement of incomplete trenches between Villers Bretonneux and Cachy. At about that time, Captain Brown led three Mark IVs to the Cachy Switch Line with orders to hold at all costs.<br/><br/>(source: user's description)<br/><br/>",

Scattered, over-extended, and out-gunned units held on, fighting desperately as reinforcements rushed into the frantic battle against the onoming IRON TIDE.<br/><br/>IRON TIDE: Panzers in the Ardennes uses a strength chit-draw mechanic to depict the uncertainties of training, combat, and the for of war. Battalions have set combat values, but regiments and brigades derive their combat strengths from chits that reflect the probable range of effectiveness of troops with a given level of training and equipment. Combined arms, artillery, aircraft, and the power of armor all weight heavily in the scales of battle.<br/><br/>IRON TIDE: Panzers in the Ardennes contains:<br/><br/>        one 28 by 42 inch map<br/>        700 die-cut backprinted counters<br/>        12-page rules booklet<br/>        one 17 by 32 inch Turn Record and Order of Battle Chart<br/>        one 8-1/2 by 11 inch Players Aid card<br/><br/><br/>(from the publisher)<br/><br/><br/>This game system makes use of hidden combat strengths.

        description: "It Never Snows is a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game covering the pivotal Market Garden offensive in September, 1944. Using a system based on the well-received SCS Game Bastogne, It Never Snows covers the landings and ground offensive endeavoring to link up with them at 600m per hex with units generally companies. Each turn is half a day making for a 17 turn campaign game (uniquely playable among Market Garden games).<br/>  <br/>The expansive five map area allows each of the airborne division fights to be geographically isolated and separate, as was the case historically. What this does is that it allows each situation to be gamed as its own little tactical puzzle&mdash;making it such that a player might be &ldquo;winning&rdquo; in one region while &ldquo;losing&rdquo; in another, at the same time. Both players are always &ldquo;in the game.&rdquo;<br/>  <br/>While the Allied player is busy dropping paratroopers, establishing bridgeheads and running a ground offensive to link up with them, the German player must devastate the airborne forces clinging to Arnhem, defend the various river crossings and counterattack to sever the Allied supply lines. Both players are attacking and defending at the same time, every turn.<br/>  <br/>Following on the heels of Bastogne, It Never Snows uses a tactical model with a minimal amount of rules overhead which shows both set-piece as well as &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; attacks and the effects of indirect fires and air support.<br/>  <br/>A fantastically detailed OOB shows the insane array of German units being scratched together to defeat the Allied offensive&mdash;from displaced sailors to the deaf, from elite armor to barely trained school units, from highly motivated SS to penal units being pushed into battle at gunpoint. Against the elite airborne troops of the Allies, this menagerie is hardly the German army many wargamers envision when they think of World War II.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>     Campaign. All five maps, all 17 turns. The full meal with players selecting their own landing sites.<br/>     Historical Drop Zones Campaign. Almost the same as the above, only with the actual drop sites listed so that players can see the real thing and not have to do that planning themselves.<br/>    Sept 18: Foothold. Here the initial drops have already happened and the battle is underway. By passing on the first turn air drops, this is a much quicker version of the campaign.<br/>    Sept 20: High Water Mark.

        description: "Five Separate Scenarios PLUS Campaign Game PLUS Links to Other Games of the Series.<br/><br/>May 1915 - First Isonzo<br/><br/>Italy decides to enter the war. Once a member of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Italy now sides with the Entente. Italy's dream is of annexing Austro-Hungarian territory inhabited by ethnic Italians. Austria-Hungary views Italy not only as traitorous, but also as its traditional enemy. The stage is set for a bloodbath. The Italian army attempts to cross a narrow path into Austria-Hungary, across the Isonzo River towards Trieste. There the Austro-Hungarian army is dug in and waiting for them.<br/><br/>May 1916 - The Strafexpedition<br/><br/>The Chief of Staff of the Austro Hungarian army, Conrad von Hotzendorff, feels the time is right to punish Italy. He ignores the German chief Falkenhayn who foresees problems on the Eastern Front. Conrad masses guns and men in the Tirol for a strike to cut off the Italian armies to the east along the Isonzo. The plan looks good on paper, but the attacks will take place across rugged country. The Italians in the southern Tirol have neglected their rear area defenses. Italian reinforcements rush to the area. It is a dicey affair, but the Italian lines hold fast. The peril to the Italian forces along the Isonzo is checked.<br/><br/>May 1917 - Tenth Isonzo<br/><br/>Again and again and again, valiant Italian infantry has been fed into the maelstrom of the Isonzo. Each battle differs from the last only by their increasing intensity. The 9th Isonzo battle brought the capture of Gorizia. Now the Italians work to enlarge their holdings on the east of the bloody Isonzo. In the end, each side is once again exhausted. The Italians have become weary of the war. Yet, the Austrians feel that one more attack along the Isonzo may be the one that breaks their army first.<br/>October 1917 - Caporreto<br/>With Russia just about finished, the German army turns to help its beleaguered ally. Crack German divisions are sent to the Italian front to remove the mortal threat to Austria-Hungary. The Austrians reinforce the front with specially trained assault units. The Italians along the headwaters of the Isonzo are overwhelmed. German and Austrian units pour through the mountain gaps and into the Italian rear. Italian units melt away in the rush to get out of the trap. The gains of the Isonzo battles are permanently lost. Enterprising Austrians cross the Tagliamento River. Further Italian retreats ensue. The rout of the Italians ends along the banks of the Piave, the last natural barrier before Venice and the open country of the Po Valley. But Italy is not defeated, and her citizens rally anew to the cause.<br/><br/>June 1918 - Albrecht &amp; Radetzky<br/><br/>The Germans are on the attack in France. Conrad wants in on the glory. Although the soldiers of the once proud Habsburg armies are weak and emaciated, they will have to go on the offensive one more time. As so often before, the Austrians split their strength between Conrad's armies in the Tirol and the forces along the Piave. Conrad's attacks from the north are ineffective. Once again the Marshal has made unrealistic plans his forces cannot execute. In the rugged mountain terrain only a single division manages to make any gains. Initial attacks across the Piave are successful, but quickly bog down. The Austrians have crossed the river, but cannot push far enough forward on the west bank to keep their pontoon bridges out of range of Italian artillery. Unable to advance, and unable to maintain viable supply lines across the river, they cross back, only to await the end.<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/><br/>       560 Die-Cut Counters<br/>       One 34in x 22in Map<br/>       Scenario Rulebook, Charts, and Tables<br/><br/><br/>Scale is 20km / hex<br/>4 days per turn<br/>Unit Sizes: Division / Brigade<br/><br/>(from the publisher's website and user's description)<br/><br/>",

Other players attempt to pinpoint the shark's location and save swimmers from shark attacks.<br/>    In the Orca phase, played on the reverse side of the game board, Brody, Hooper and Quint are aboard the sinking ship engaging in a climactic battle against the shark, while using additional action and strategy cards to defend the Orca from targeted shark attacks.<br/><br/><br/>If humans kill the shark, they win; if the shark attack on the Orca succeeds, the great white shark wins.<br/><br/>",

        description: "The Jaws of Victory: Battle of Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket: January/February 1944 is a historical simulation of the Soviet's winter offensive in the Ukraine in the early months of 1944 that trapped the better part of two German corps with a classic pincer movement by two Soviet Armies - and the German Army's desperate response to relieve their beleaguered comrades in the pocket.<br/><br/>Following the defeat of the German Kursk Offensive in July of 1943, the Soviets unleashed a series of major offensives to clear the Ukraine of the German Army.  By mid-January of 1944, the Red Army had liberated the area north and east of the Dnepr and seized Kiev. Further south, they crossed the Dnepr bend, capturing Kirovograd and continued deep into the western Ukraine.  The Germans, however, maintained a hold on the Dnepr near Korsun in an exposed salient 70 miles southwest of Kiev.  Hitler insisted on holding the salient and refused requests from his generals to withdraw to more defensible positions.  This exposed salient was too tempting a target for the Soviets and in January, 1944 Stavka ordered the 1st &amp; 2nd Ukrainian Fronts to conduct a major operation; striking against the base of the salient to surround and eliminate two German Corps within.  The 2nd Ukrainian Front would breakthrough in the east on the 25th and race westward while the 1st Ukrainian Front would attack toward the east a day later; sealing the pocket at Zvenigorodka.  The Soviet offensive was a stunning success, slamming the gate on 60,000 men from six German divisions, including the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking.  But, the Germans were not about to let the Korsun pocket become another &quot;Stalingrad&quot;.  Within a week they struck back with eight panzer divisions in a two-pronged counter-stroke of their own; this time to deal the Red Army an unexpected defeat from the Jaws of Victory.<br/><br/>Seven separate scenarios covering the period from January 26 to February 18, including a 25-turn campaign game, allow both sides plenty of opportunities for offensive and defensive action.<br/><br/>As the Soviet player, you begin with a two-pronged offensive, striking hard at the base of the German salient in an attempt to trap as many German units as possible.  If you succeed, you must then turn your attention southward to build the &quot;outer ring&quot; in preparation for the German counter-offensive, while systematically chewing away at the supply-starved defenders in the pocket.<br/><br/>As the German player, you must slow the Soviet drives from both east and west by fighting a two-front defense, and if possible bring them to a halt.  Once the pocket forms, you must skillfully hang on and preserve as many of the trapped units as possible, and wait for you Panzer Divisions from the south to carve open an escape route.<br/><br/>And both sides will have to contend with overstretched supply line, bad weather, and tank-stopping mud.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Divisions<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>    Five dual-side printed countersheet (1,170 1/2&quot; counters - 4 full size &amp; 1 half countersheets)<br/>    One 32-page Jaws of Victory Rule Book<br/>    One 28-page Jaws of Victory Play Book<br/>    One single-side printed Game-Turn Record Track<br/>    One dual-side printed Sequence of Play Chart<br/>    One single-side printed Combat Phase Sequence Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed German Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed Soviet Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed Terrain Effects Chart<br/>    One single-side printed Combat Results Table<br/>    Eight Dual-Side printed Scenario Cards (4 German &amp; 4 Soviet)<br/>    One dual-side printed Combat Manuals/Credits/Historical wrapper<br/>    One single-side printed Game Errata card<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Moderate-High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 6-50 hours<br/><br/>",

        description: "(from Avalanche Press website:)<br/><br/>Third Reich interweaves not only the land, naval and air struggles, but also the equally important economic and political battles. Players must guide their nation to victory by capturing key objectives while making sure no one else &mdash; in particular their allies &mdash; gets there first.<br/><br/>Players take on the leadership of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States or the Soviet Union. Each of these major powers, in turn, can influence smaller countires like Turkey, Greece or Romania to join the war on their side. They can offer bribes or territory, and sometimes it&rsquo;s more important to decrease someone else&rsquo;s influence than to build up your own.<br/><br/>The currency of the game is the Basic Resource Point, or BRP. This represents the financial, industrial and agricultural production needed to wage war. BRP&rsquo;s are used to build new units, to pay for offensives, to replace losses suffered in battle, to bribe minor countries, and for a host of other purposes. Each country&rsquo;s production can be affected by conquering or losing territory, or through strategic warfare (chiefly, attacks by submarines and bombers).<br/><br/>Once activated (usually at a cost in BRP&rsquo;s), land, naval and air units can move and attack enemy units. Combat is resolved by rolling dice, with a result of 6 usually equalling a hit. There are no Combat Results Tables; every factor counts and there are no &ldquo;perfect numbers&rdquo; of units to commit to battle as in some wargames. When a land unit is hit, BRP&rsquo;s can be used to absorb some of the damage, but too many hits and it is reduced in strength or destroyed. Naval and air units pack a greater punch, but don&rsquo;t bounce back from damage as easily.<br/><br/>Scenarios, or game situations, begin the game in 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 or 1945. Political markers are randomly chosen to determine what events might take place outside the players&rsquo; control: Poland might capitulate to Germany in 1939, Mussolini, Churchill or Hitler might unleash some stupid scheme the Italian, British or German player will have to execute, oil could be found in Libya, the French navy could rally to the Allies or the Axis, jets can be developed, good Germans might kill Hitler &mdash; dozens of such events are possible.<br/><br/><br/>As one of the most popular games of all time, our edition of Third Reich has also spawned a sequel, Great Pacific War. The two games can be played together or separately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)Avalanche Press' re-release of the original classic. This is a significant overhaul based on the Avalon Hill Third Reich, and has nothing to do with the later Advanced Third Reich.<br/><br/>There has been dramatic simplification and streamlining, however. Gone is the CRT, replaced by a Columbia-esque &quot;roll lots of dice&quot; combat resolution system. The whole front/option system has been revised with an &quot;HQ activation marker&quot; system: each nation buys activation markers for HQs, land, and air units, and puts them in a cup. Turn order is then determined by draws. Naval and air systems have been overhauled and simplified: sea zones now regulate movement. Tactical air support is now limited to being equal to the strength of the attacker/defender, not three times.<br/><br/>Also includes 1938 (Spanish Civil War boils over to a general European conflict) and 1945 scenarios (Western Allies and Russia fall out after collapse of Germany).<br/><br/>",

        description: '&quot;Julian&quot;, designed by Joseph Miranda, is a wargame of intermediate complexity simulating the situation across the Roman Empire in the 4th century AD. There are two opposing players: Roman and Barbarian. The Roman player represents the high command of a centralized empire; the Barbarian player represents the various chaotic forces working to destroy that empire. The Roman objective is to reconsolidate the threatened empire and secure its frontier regions to prevent further barbarian invasion. The Barbarian objective is to grab as much Roman territory as possible. The game system is based on the one originally presented in our earlier S&amp;T games: Series: They Died With Their Boots On (Decision Games).<br/><br/>The Barbarian side is divided into &ldquo;forces,&rdquo; each representing an independent people or coalition of tribes, such as the Goths. The Persians and Armenians, though commanded in the game by the barbarian player, are considered &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; forces (along with all Roman and rebel units).<br/><br/>Each turn represents one year. Each hexagon on the map represents 100 miles (162 km) from side to opposite side. Each unit represents 10,000 to 30,000 troops and camp followers, etc. Special rules cover such things as: usurpation, stratagems, random events, reinforcements, pursuit, taxation, Caesar and Augustus units, naval movement, fortresses and bases, fog of war, the Huns, political crises, tribal homelands, militia, field armies, supply trains, pursuit combat, amphibious operations, pillage, civic works, and more.<br/><br/>',

The British Second Army, scheduled to take Caen on D-Day, is held up short of that objective with heavy losses for the entire month by fanatical and skillful German resistance.

A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.<br/><br/>Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.<br/><br/>If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President. And someone is sent to the firing squad.<br/><br/>Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.<br/><br/>The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.<br/><br/>",

Players assume command of either army and take turns to execute their orders for their forces.<br/><br/>In this game, units exert a zone of control around them, forcing opposing units to maneuver around them to avoid being stopped in their tracks.  Engagements between units are resolved by consulting results of dice rolls modified by terrain, leadership, and other factors against charts.  Airborne assaults and air support are also part and parcel of the combat.  Keeping units in reserve is a strategical option, allowing players to immediately exploit breakthroughs and redeploy after battles.<br/><br/>The game ends after a certain number of rounds.

        description: "(from MMP website:)<br/><br/>Karelia &rsquo;44 is an operational level game that focuses on the last major campaign of the Russo-Finnish Continuation War (25 June 42&mdash;4 Sept 44). STAVKA planned an offensive during the summer of 1944 to coincide with the Normandy landings. The objective was to force Finland out of the war. Towards this end, the Soviets amassed two ground armies, one air army, and an impressive amount of artillery. Confident after a series of victories against the Germans, the Red Army attacked in Karelia on 9 June 44. The attack began with an overwhelming artillery barrage (second only to the Oder crossings in intensity). Finnish lines were pushed back and then breached&mdash;the race for Viipuri/Vyborg was on. The capture of this city would open the road to Helsinki.<br/><br/>The game features a unique &ldquo;Boss Point&rdquo; System which precludes either player from knowing how long the game will last. For the Russian player, this represents the gun to his head of an unhappy dictator who will gladly send you to a Gulag forever if you fail in your goals. For the Finns, you know that you are understrength and that the Russians will destroy you if given enough time, but you need to hang on for dear life in order to be in the best possible position when the Boss&rsquo; patience runs out.<br/><br/>Players will find two very different armies to command. The Russians are the proverbial 500 lb gorilla, but one that takes time to prepare big operations and isn&rsquo;t fleet of foot enough to do small scale attacks.<br/><br/>The Finns have splendid artillery and are designed for a mobile defense which, if done right, will leave the Russians flailing in the air. You have three defensive lines to use and an innovative &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; unit feature that allows your thin ranks to try to hang on to them.<br/><br/>Please note, this is not the Winter War of 1939! This is a well developed late war Russian army, not the hapless troops of the opening years of the war. The Finns need to be on their toes to stand a chance.<br/><br/>Karelia '44 is the 14th game in the award winning Standard Combat Series.

First Panzer Army had been cut-off by a total of nine Soviet armies. Its breakout began on March 25, 1944, and continued into early April. In these two weeks, the Germans continuously conducted a mobile defense as their pocket drove westward in an effort to meet a relief force (which was spearheaded by the II SS Panzer Corps) attacking eastward. Supplied by air much of the time, First Panzer Army deceived the Soviet forces by moving west, instead of south as the Soviet generals had anticipated. The pocket crossed several swollen rivers, and struggled through thick mud and deep snow, yet somehow remained intact. Unlike the Korsun Pocket disaster the month before, this time the Germans avoided yet another debacle.

The game has several scenarios, representing the initial Mongol explosion out of Central Asia, the later campaigns of consolidation in the era of Kublai Khan, and a grand scenario representing the entire era.<br/><br/>Khan is a two-player game. The Mongol player controls the forces of the Mongols themselves, as well as their various subject peoples. The Kingdoms player controls various independent states and rebels who are opposed to the Mongols. The Mongol player, representing a single, centralized empire, has more direct control over his forces. The Kingdoms player, representing a range of sometimes competing powers, will find the game system causes various subordinate forces to enter and exit from his control at different times. Both player's forces are represented by military units and stratagem markers. Players must use a combination of military strength and cunning strategy to expand their power or defend their independence.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents five years. Each hex is approximately 100 miles across. Each military unit represents 10,000 &ndash; 100,000 troops, plus pack animals, camp followers, bureaucrats, etc. Each leader represents a single great person or cadre of generals and officials, plus an elite bodyguard.<br/><br/>",

Its objective was to eliminate the Izium bridgehead over Seversky Donets or the &quot;Barvenkovo bulge&quot; which was one of the Soviet offensive's staging areas. After a winter counter-offensive that drove German troops away from Moscow but depleted the Red Army's reserves, the Kharkov offensive was a new Soviet attempt to expand upon their strategic initiative, although it failed to secure a significant element of surprise.<br/><br/>On 12 May 1942, both the Soviet Southwestern and Southern Fronts under the command of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko launched an offensive against the German 6th Army from a salient established during the winter counter-offensive. After a promising start, the offensive was stopped on 15 May by massive airstrikes. Critical Soviet errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly raised forces, facilitated a German pincer attack on 17 May which cut off three Soviet field armies from the rest of the front by 22 May. Hemmed into a narrow area, the 250,000-strong Soviet force inside the pocket was exterminated from all sides by German armored, artillery and machine gun firepower as well as 7,700 tonnes of air-dropped bombs. After six days of encirclement, Soviet resistance ended as their troops were killed or taken prisoner.<br/><br/>The battle was an overwhelming German victory, with 280,000 Soviet casualties compared to just 20,000 for the Germans and their allies. The German Army Group South pressed its advantage, encircling the Soviet 28th Army on 13 June in Operation Wilhelm and pushing back the 38th and 9th Armies on 22 June in Operation Fridericus II as preliminary operations to Case Blue, which was launched on 28 June as the main German offensive on the Eastern Front in 1942.<br/><br/>Kharkov uses the Panzergruppe Guderian system.

        description: "New England Simulations revisits a familiar World War II venue -- the hedgerows of Normandy -- with some refreshing twists in The Killing Ground: Campaign for Normandy, July-August 1944&quot;. The game combines a mechanic usually reserved for smaller games -- a chit pull combat system -- with two gorgeous maps, 900 counters, and a 36-page rulebook that should have &quot;Don't Panic!&quot; inscribed on its cover (the designer was content to place the warning on the first page of rules instead).<br/><br/>As you read the rules, you get the feeling that the designer wants to bring back the best parts of the &quot;good old days&quot; of wargaming -- that newfound excitement and thrill you once had that gradually wore off as you slogged through the complexity of the latest SPI monster. The rulebook is written almost in prose, gently explaining each rule and including historical footnotes when appropriate. Though long, it is well-organized and easily cross-referenced.<br/><br/>The graphics are detailed but subtle, aiding play without distracting the player. A fair amount of information is packed on each counter. Player aids are plentiful.<br/><br/>The game itself focuses on post-invasion Normandy, where the Germans are trying to delay and attrite the Allies prior to their inevitable breakout. As much of the victory depends on the Allies' ability to maintain momentum throughout the campaign as it does capturing key victory point hexes -- any signs of trench warfare or, worse, seesaw battling over villages is severely penalized.<br/><br/>In yet another attempt to limit intelligence, the combat system includes a combat effectiveness 'chit pull' system that disguises actual unit combat strength up to the last moment. The system adds a level of uncertainty to the game that leads to unexpected combat results and tempers any tendency to attack without some forethought.<br/><br/>Although primarily designed for two players, the game can accommodate up to four given its size and attention to detail. The Killing Ground includes five scenarios, all historical.<br/><br/>Game Scale<br/>Units: Primarily regimental with tank and other support units as battalions.<br/>Time: Each game-turn is 1 day.<br/>Map: 2.5km per hex.<br/><br/>A complete game of The Killing Ground will include the following:<br/>1 rules booklet<br/>1 Combat Manual<br/>2 map sections (22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; each)<br/>3 different countersheets (900 counters printed front &amp; back)<br/>6 different charts (Combat Results Table, Allied Air Allocation Chart, US Army Support Points chart, British/Canadian Army Support Points chart, Game-Turn Record Track, Scenario Card).<br/>2 six-sided dice<br/>1 game box<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Overlord: D-Day and the Beachhead Battles<br/><br/><br/>",

The economic devastation caused by the financial irresponsibility of the Roaring Twenties created massive job losses, business failures, and a crisis of confidence in the political institutions of the day, including democracy itself. Many people sought a solution to their problems through simplistic &lsquo;set the world right in ten lessons&rsquo; schemes such as the Technocracy or Social Credit movements, but others put their trust in radical political movements of the far left and right such as the German-American Bund organization, the Wobblies, and the Communist Party. Still others learned the value of simple corruption and demagoguery, as Governor Huey Long did in Louisiana.<br/><br/>&ldquo;In the game, two or three players represent extremist political organizations trying to gain power through covert means, at regional and (when they are strong enough) at Federal level. A process of patient organization and propaganda will result in an accumulation of influence, which will translate into power, which has its own rewards. It is also possible to try and muscle one&rsquo;s way into power by intimidation and strong-arm tactics.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Historically, this game lies somewhere between realism and fantasy.  Players try to build committees and fronts, gain control of the local police, aim to gain political control of the states, and eventually influence the national elections for President.  Along the way there are mobs, vote-rigging, and assassinations &ndash; Maybe Upton Sinclair will be elected governor of California this time . . .<br/><br/>The game comes with 280 counters and an 11&rdquo;x17&rdquo; map of the continental United States divided into 20 regions (combinations of individual states in to regions with names like &ldquo;Minneconsin&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kennesee&rdquo;.)<br/><br/>',

By that time it had become clear the invaders had shot their bolt without achieving their objectives. The game may end sooner than the historic termination time if the German player is able to advance so quickly he causes the overall political, socio-economic and military collapse of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 20 miles (32 km) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with Axis-satellite and Soviet corps (and one army) of various types. The effects of the general air superiority enjoyed by the Germans throughout the campaign are built into the movement and combat rules. Each game turn represents one week.<br/><br/>Players familiar with other strategic-level east front designs will note the unique aspects of LWE lie in its rules governing the treatment of supply, the capture of Moscow, and the Stalin line.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>     Rules booklet<br/>     Player Aid cards<br/>     700 Die cut counters<br/>     1 34&quot; x 22&quot; Map<br/>     1 Die<br/>     Storage bags<br/><br/><br/>',

        description: 'Last Blitzkrieg is the first entry in the new Series: Battalion Combat Series (MMP), which simulates combat in World War II (and beyond) at the battalion scale. Its subject is the German Ardennes offensive Wacht Am Rhein (the Battle of the Bulge) on four detailed maps (at 1km per hex) and with 1,680 counters. Last Blitzkrieg covers the battle in a level of detail rarely seen before and does so in a very playable manner. The BCS itself was designed to show that battalion level combat is its own subject, being neither &quot;small divisions&quot; nor &quot;large platoons&quot;.

        description: '(from MMP website:)<br/><br/>Last Chance for Victory is the next entry in The Gamers&rsquo; Line of Battle series (LoB) which simulates the Battle of Gettysburg. It is the second game in the series, following the well received None But Heroes about the Battle of Antietam.<br/><br/>The story of Gettysburg is well known or, I should say, the popular rendition of the battle is well known and has certainly been simulated multiple times.<br/><br/>As is usually the case with stripped down, accepted versions of complex events, this narrative misses much flavor and a deeper understanding of what went on. It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;auto-tour&rsquo; version of a much more involved event.<br/><br/>Many things are simply not brought out, or put into proper context, in the affirmed version of the battle:<br/><br/>1)     Lee arrived on the field and tried to get his footing when Ewell (on his own initiative) ordered Rodes and Early to attack. Lee wasted no time in ordering Hill to attack with Heth and Pender to support Ewell&rsquo;s Corps. In the commonly held view, Lee arrived and simply dithered while events unfolded outside his control.<br/><br/>2)    There were several opportunities that afternoon and evening to advance and take Cemetery and/or Culp&rsquo;s Hills. These were missed&hellip; but not, as commonly assumed, because one or more leaders were staring at their navels confused or indecisive. What happened and why?<br/><br/>3)    Ewell made a clear headed decision his men were in no condition to take the hill that evening. He was the commander on the spot. Since then historians and armchair generals everywhere have questioned that decision, the game allows you to see who was right. Ewell was of the opinion that he could only do it if 3rd Corps supported him. That support was ordered by Lee (using 3rd Corps&rsquo; artillery) but was not implemented by the army&rsquo;s chief of artillery. Would that have allowed the attack to work? What was the relative condition of the Union defenders and the potential attacking troops anyway?<br/><br/>4)    There never was any sort of &lsquo;dawn attack&rsquo; order, but there were orders to attack much earlier on the second day than actually occurred. The game allows you to find out what went wrong (so you can draw your own conclusions as to who to blame).<br/><br/>5)    By evening of the 2nd day, the fate of Cemetery Ridge rested in the hands of a handful of formed Union regiments (including the human sacrifice of the 1st Minnisota). Confederate victory was very, very close&mdash;teetering in the balance much more than normally assumed. There was a reason Lee said that if Dorsey Pender remained in command for another 30 minutes, the Confederates would have won the battle. See just how tough the Union job was and how close to the edge they got. What would have been the result of that 2nd day&rsquo;s attack had it launched just a few hours earlier or even at the same time, but with the coordinated use of Anderson&rsquo;s and Pender&rsquo;s divisions?<br/><br/>6)    Everyone assumes Pickett&rsquo;s Charge was a forlorn, desperate, throw of the dice, but what was the condition of many of the Union units manning that ridge? Was this attack a complete reworking of the Confederate battle plan out of blind frustration or was it a continuation of the plan from both earlier days? What was the earlier, theoretically coordinated, plan the attack was ad libbed from?<br/><br/>7)    As a whole, the popular version of the battle pretty much assumes a Union victory unless multiple stars aligned for the Confederates. If this is so, did the Army of the Potomac have to merely put out a &lsquo;fair-to-middl&rsquo;in&rsquo; effort or did they have to fight tooth and nail to gain victory? If the latter, just how close of a run was it? Doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;assuming they will win&rdquo; take away well earned credit they had for finally overcoming a determined and usually successful foe?<br/><br/>Last Chance for Victory attempts to allow players to find their own answers to these questions and points as well as many others. The added depth and nuance makes for a very different and, in my opinion, more accurate rendition of the battle than you&rsquo;ve ever seen before.<br/><br/>Aside from showing the history in a way that will be both entertaining but make you thirst for more and better reading on the topic, multiple variations are provided to explore the battle. Sure, there are the usual &ldquo;extra troops&rdquo; variants, but more importantly, options that allow players to tweak the various historical behavior &lsquo;knobs&rsquo; I assigned. If you think my &lsquo;setting&rsquo; for Howard (to pull a name out of a hat) are all wet, you can change him to be better (or worse) so you can see how your version &lsquo;plays.&rsquo; Likewise, a number of rules simulate activities that were pretty much out of the player&rsquo;s hands (such as Buford&rsquo;s need to screen the town yet keep his losses very low), these can be &lsquo;turned off&rsquo; as desired to see what effect they really have on the battle. There is a matrix of the various &lsquo;control&rsquo; rules and the possible &lsquo;settings&rsquo; for each one that players can use before starting if they disagree with my decisions. The results of your choices might surprise you and spur your understanding of the battle to new levels.<br/><br/>As with None But Heroes, Last Chance for Victory is designed to bring all of this and much more to your table in the most historically accurate and informational jam-packed game possible. Like any LoB game, it was designed with twin goals: the most insight possible and a game with maximum playability.<br/><br/>Enhancing the already well received and streamlined Line of Battle rules, Last Chance for Victory comes with the v2.0 series rules. These rules incorporate the refinements and suggestions of hundreds of real players which make this smooth system even faster to play. Make no mistake, this is the only regimental level Gettysburg game that can be played to completion at a respectable clip&mdash;yet it is a large game. A pair of reasonably fast players could play the campaign game to completion at a convention like ConsimExpo. I&rsquo;ve completed campaign games with three players in a week of rather relaxed play time.<br/><br/>Scenarios abound of various sizes. The campaign uses a 4-map &lsquo;box&rsquo; layout, but the game comes with two additional maps, one covering just the 1st Day&rsquo;s fighting and the other the 2nd and 3rd Day&rsquo;s. The big game scenarios can be played on one or both of those maps and, with those two linked together, it is possible to play the entire battle on 2 maps.<br/><br/>It replaces This Hallowed Ground from the RSS-series.<br/><br/>',

The eight scenarios contained herein focus on historical situations involving the early German blitzkriegs of World War II and the many nationalities that fought against the invaders. Paratroopers, armor, air power, audacity and courage were the tools with which Germany planned to overrun the neutral nations of Europe.  and in less than two years, in actions as far apart as Norway and Crete, the German military accomplished all they had set out to do.  <br/>For the most part, the invaded neutrals (Poland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia and Greece) were defended by hastily-mobilized reservists stiffened by a few elite units.  The actions depicted in THE LAST HURRAH will challenge veteran ASL players to match the tenacity, audacity and victories on both sides in eight scenarios, recreating the German march of conquest.  Experience - as only ASL can let you - the desperate fighting of these first days of World War II.  Whether commanding German armor, Polish cavalry, Greek infantry, Belgian Chasseurs, Norwegian reservists or Luftwaffe paratroopers, if you're an ASL grognard, you're bound to find something pleasing in the wide spectrum of scenarios included in THE LAST HURRAH.

Differing combinations of heroes, scenarios, and board configurations offer a lot of replayability.<br/><br/>A hero deck and a zombie deck deliver tactical bonuses to each side. Combat is resolved using six-sided dice, modified by the weapon cards with which heroes may be equipped. Many of the cards include zombie movie tropes to achieve a feel of playing out a horror movie. All the game art is photographic, enhancing the cinematic feel. The game also comes with a CD soundtrack of original thematic music.<br/><br/>Each hero has its own plastic sculpted miniature.

The game is played in turns that represent five days.  A unit's strength point represents approximately 2,500 men commanded by a leader.  The map is a 1:200,000 representation of an area between Fredricksburg and Petersburg.<br/><br/>The game is split into two: Basic and Advanced.  The basic game introduces players to the concepts of movement and unit activation.  The advanced game adds sea movement, supply, and additional leader rules. Victory conditions depends on the scenario being played.<br/><br/>Lee vs. Grant is arguably the first game in the GCACW series by the same designer albeit from a different (though related) publisher and with a different map art style.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Libert&eacute; covers the French Revolution from 1789 and the meeting of the Estates General to the Directory and Bonaparte&rsquo;s coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1799. <br/> The game is played in four turns. In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.<br/><br/>The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.<br/><br/>The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.<br/><br/>Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.  The player who is ahead on points must be aware that one mistake could lead to defeat at the hands of the Jacobins or Royalists!<br/><br/>It is likely that you will never have played a game quite like this one and you may find yourself wondering what strategies to employ.  Do not despair!  Once you have completed your first game you will realize that amongst the apparent chaos of the game there are many opportunities for long-term planning.<br/><br/>Libert&eacute; is #6 in the Valley Games Classic Line<br/><br/>",

Here, the battlefield is an extension of the political arena. Many historical movers and shakers support or oppose their presidents&rsquo; war plans. Will Mr. Lincoln save the Union? Will Mr. Davis succeed in sundering one nation and creating another? How will you direct their political support?<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War is a card-driven game using cards to activate generals, but in Lincoln&rsquo;s War, activation numbers are also political currency or PC. PC not only activates generals but promotes worthy commanders, purchases war material, forces indecisive commanders to act, and represents support for the war. A decisive PC point spread is an advantage in winning the game but driving an opponent to 0 PC (and 0 Congressional support) at the end of a turn will ensure victory, even in the face of defeat.<br/><br/>Unique features include a diceless combat system, seditious characters, and immobilization tokens. The combat system requires players to husband resources and congressional political support to ensure victory. Seditious characters oppose their respective Presidents&rsquo; handling of the war and sooner or later will erode a president&rsquo;s vital political support. Immobilization tokens reflect damage in the form of casualties, as well as hesitation, confusion and even insubordination.<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War contains:<br/>    1 22&quot; x 34&quot; map<br/>    1 color rulebook<br/>    1 color play and background booklet<br/>    162 Operations Cards<br/>    2 countersheets<br/>    2 player aid cards<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War was designed by John Poniske with the assistance of Mike Joslyn, and features the artwork of Niko Eskubi and map artwork by Mark Mahaffey.<br/><br/>(source: MMP website)<br/><br/>',

During a typical game turn, both players move their company sized forces over a map of the battle area, positioning them for rifle fire and bayonet charges.

One of the most important campaigns occurred in southeastern Tennessee and Georgia, as Federal armies pressed toward the Confederacy&rsquo;s vital city of Atlanta, home to much of its remaining industry and gateway to the southern and western lands the Confederates still held. The campaign for and siege of this vital city broke the power of the Army of Tennessee, the key rebel command outside northern Virginia.<br/><br/>The theater of these operations is roughly bounded by the Tennessee River to the north, the Chattanooga area to the west, Atlanta to the south, and the Appalachian Mountains to the east. It was here where the formidable Union command team of Sherman and Thomas plied their trade, dooming the Confederacy's last chance to survive the Yankee onslaught. Here too the soldiers of the rebel Army of Tennessee fought stubbornly to defend their homes.<br/><br/>Look Away!

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.<br/>To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.<br/><br/>As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.<br/><br/>MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.<br/>The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.<br/><br/>Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9<br/><br/>See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.<br/><br/>',

To control complexity and present an overall-force-commander's-view of the battle, the game uses a tactically scaled map and units of maneuver coupled with an operationally scaled game turn length. The American player is generally on the offensive, trying to clear the entire Japanese defending force from the city prior to the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each game turn of M'45 equals three days. Each hexagon on the map represents 0.3 miles (0.5 km) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver in the game are companies, batteries and battalions, representing anywhere from a about 100 to 1,000 men and their equipment.<br/><br/>Historically the Japanese fought to the last man (literally, not metaphorically), and the game's victory conditions represent that brutally absolute mindset. To determine the winner, both players examine the map at the end of Game Turn 10. If at that time there's one or more Japanese units still in play anywhere, the Japanese player is declared to have won the game. If there are no Japanese units left on the map at that time, the US player is declared to have won the game. Of course, if all Japanese units are wiped out prior to the end of the last game turn, play stops and the US player is declared the victor. No draws are possible.<br/><br/>Tacticians will enjoy the fact there are 22 unit types in the game: heavy artillery, heavy anti-aircraft, heavy mortar, heavy rocket artillery, naval infantry (armed ship crews), regular infantry, combat engineers, heavy weapons (machineguns), anti-aircraft, military police, anti-tank, field artillery, rear echelon ad hoc infantry, glider infantry, paratroopers, bridging engineers, mortars, armored cavalry, tanks, self-propelled artillery, amphibious tractors, and self-propelled anti-tank.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Marlborough: War of the Spanish Succession (&quot;Marby,&quot; for short), is a wargame of intermediate-to-high complexity, designed by Joseph Miranda, simulating that critical conflict of the early 18th century. The dynastic struggle began when France's Louis XIV attempted to place his grandson, Philip IV, on the throne of Spain. The other major powers saw that as a threat, and so supported their own candidate, Charles III. That in turn began over a decade of fighting that grew into a general struggle for domination over all of western Europe.<br/><br/>Marby is a two player game. One controls the forces of France and its allies, known as the Bourbon coalition, after the ruling house of France. The other player controls the forces opposing France, led by England and Austria and known as the Grand Alliance. Each player has a variety of military, diplomatic and economic instruments with which he can attempt to win the game by controlling states and economic centers.<br/><br/>The game includes several scenarios. Shorter scenarios represent critical parts of the war, while the &quot;Grand Design&quot; scenario covers the entire war. Certain rules are designated &quot;optional,&quot; and the players don't have to use them. The optional rules are suggested for use only when playing the Grand Design scenario, as they add considerable complexity, historical detail and playing time.<br/><br/>The 34x22&quot; large-hex map shows western and central Europe during the early 18th century. The grid of hexagons printed over the map provides locations for playing pieces and geographic features. During the game, the cardboard pieces are placed within individual hexes.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents one year; each hex scales to 50 miles. Each army represents 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers and support personnel, camp followers, etc. A leader represents that person plus his guards, entourage, lackeys, wine cellars, etc. A fleet represents 60 warships and an indeterminate number of transports. The rules run to some 17,000 words, making for play sessions lasting from four to 12 hours.<br/><br/>",

        description: "From the publisher's web page (Medieval):<br/><br/>Medieval is a card-based board game that takes players back to the turbulent 13th century in Europe, Middle East and North Africa. The cards not only represent the Powers, various capabilities, and events that the players use to gain victory, but they also provide the playing board, a map that is divided into 19 Cards, only 8 of which start the game in play. The rest of the Map Cards - and the map - come into play randomly, but at the players' pace.<br/><br/>The remaining cards are for the 27 Powers - countries from the strong but troubled Holy Roman Empire, England and France, through the various Islamic powers, down to such minor, but important, countries such as The Kingdom of Jerusalem, Livonia and Trebizond. Even such mysterious and far away areas as Polovtsy and The Cumans come into play. - and the various &quot;events&quot; the players use to forward their schemes.<br/><br/>Each Player represents an ever-changing conglomerate of these Powers, using his wiles, and the cards, to further his control over areas of Europe to win the game. There are Spies, Assassins, accusations of Heresy, Jihads, even the use of the various Knights of Christ.<br/><br/>And then there are the Popes. Each player, randomly, can become Pope (they're named and historical). As Pope he can arrange alliances, excommunicate players, and call for Crusades (a great way to make money).<br/><br/>But hovering like a very, very black cloud over all of this are The Mongols. No player knows exactly when they start to arrive, although the card play does give them hints &hellip; and some time to prepare, if they choose to heed the warnings. But when they do arrive, all Tartar Hell breaks loose, as The Mongols, also represented by cards, literally eat the map, east to west, conquering Powers, chewing them up and making them disappear from European view.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who survives the onslaughts of religion and the Mongols to control the largest part of 13th century Europe.<br/><br/>Medieval is for 3 to 5 players and takes around 2 hours to play, once you've learned the system. It comes with 110 cards, lots of little pieces, and coin-shaped florin markers.<br/><br/>",

And with Memoir '44 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.<br/><br/>The Memoir '44 series consists of the base game and a number of expansions.<br/><br/>This game is based upon Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.<br/><br/>",

The scenarios highlight the key elements that made these battles so fascinating: the defensive power of the longbow, especially when used in coordination with dismounted, or even mounted, men-at-arms. Given the right deployments and forces, the inability to take advantage of the marvelous abilities of the vaunted knights, the finest mounted force in Europe, became something of a surprise to many &quot;experts.&quot;<br/><br/>Men of Iron is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, there are no &quot;turns&quot; - play is Continual, with ample opportunities to steal play from your opponent - and combat resolution is a single dieroll.

It showed that infantry, supported by archers, could defeat the best knights in Europe.<br/>     Poitiers - France, 19 September 1356 - The French fight dismounted this time and almost win.

Historically, of course, the German dictator chose instead to halt the AGC, temporarily de-emphasizing Moscow as a target while diverting his forces' strength on the front's northern and southern sectors. Here we assume he chose instead to reorganize the mobile divisions of Panzer Groups 2 and 3 and ad hoc Panzer Army Guderian, putting that general in charge of a daring effort to take Moscow, thereby winning the war by plunging the entire Soviet Union into strategic paralysis.<br/><br/>This is a two-player, operational-level, alternative history wargame of low complexity. In it, the German player controls all Panzer Army Guderian units and is opposed by the Soviet player who controls all the Red Army units.<br/><br/>The situation is inescapably such that the German player controls the strategic initiative and sets the overall tempo of play. We therefore recommend opponents who share a particularly competitive relationship should play a series of matches, switching sides each time, before deciding who between them owns bragging rights to the game.<br/><br/>1 hex : 9 miles<br/>GT : 1 day<br/>Units : divisions and brigades (3000-12000 men and/or about 50 to 180 armored vehicles)<br/><br/>",

It was one of America's most unpopular wars and &ldquo;Mr. Madison's War - The Incredible War of 1812&rdquo; is a strategy game based on the US campaigns to take Canada in the years 1812 - 1814.<br/><br/>The map board measures 35&rdquo;x24&rdquo; and covers the the northern part of the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and the Canadian provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, the area where most of the battles were fought. The game features over 203 counters that feature the named regiments and battalions that fought the war including militia and Indian units. Also included are named individual Schooner, Brigs and Frigates that fought the naval war on the great lakes. The principal leaders of the war are included such as Major General Isaac Brock, Sir George Prevost, Major General Hull and many others.<br/><br/>The game utilizes the new 'card driven system' which enable players to perform their actions on the game board and score automatic points for the playing of a card as an historical event. The colorful cards include historical information, the year the event took place and a detailed description of the function of the card. There are 110 individual cards in the game.<br/><br/>The illustrated Rule Book is approximately 20 pages long, and there are 5 player aid sheets that contain the Combat Results Table along with cards to set up the various reinforcements.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to gain Victory Points by invading your enemy's territory while maintaining your own. In complexity the game would be rated as average and would appeal to any student of the Napoleonic Wars in general. It is at present the most comprehensive treatment of the War of 1812 yet offered to the public.<br/><br/>The publisher, GMT Games, also produced a mounted map for this game which was sold separately.<br/><br/>",

After escaping disaster in the Wilderness (when arguably only the wounding of Confederate General James Longstreet salvaged a stalemate from sure defeat), Grant now found himself grinding his army against the deadly abrasive of Rebel entrenchments.<br/><br/>Desperate for a clean, quick solution, Grant listened attentively to the notions of a brash 24 year old Colonel named Emory Upton. Attack on a narrow front, Upton maintained, and do not pause to fire. The condensed mass, several lines deep, would simply ram its way across the parapets. The first line, after making initial penetration would then fan left and right, widening the breach. The succeeding lines would drive straight ahead, deepening the plunge. A reserve would then arrive, to stem the sure gray counterattack.<br/><br/>Mule Shoe Salient is a regimental-level simulation of the Federal assault on May 12, 1864 at The Bloody Angle, which was the culmination of the Battle of Spotsylvania.<br/><br/>Each unit represents several companies of 120 men/strength point, or artillery sections representing 2 guns.

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.<br/><br/>				<br/>				<br/>					Sequels:<br/><br/><br/>    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin<br/>    Munchkin Apocalypse<br/>    Munchkin Axe Cop<br/>    Munchkin Bites!<br/>    Munchkin Booty<br/>    Munchkin Conan<br/>    Munchkin Cthulhu<br/>    Munchkin Fu<br/>    Munchkin Impossible<br/>    Munchkin Legends<br/>    Munchkin Pathfinder<br/>    Munchkin Zombies<br/>    Star Munchkin<br/>    Super Munchkin<br/><br/><br/>				<br/>				<br/>					Related Board Games<br/><br/><br/>    Munchkin Quest<br/><br/><br/>				<br/>				<br/>					Online play<br/><br/><br/>     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

        description: "Napoleon at Leipzig, 1813 - His Grande Arm&eacute;e shattered on the Russian Steppes, Napoleon tries to regain the initiative in Germany. His former allies Prussia and Austria turn traitor and attack him. Tsarist Russia sends a massive army across the Vistula into Europe proper.<br/><br/>Draining every reserve the French Empire has left, Napoleon gathers his loyal Rhinelanders, Italians, Saxons and Poles. Seizing the initiative in the Spring, he defeats the Allied Coalition at Lutzen, and then at Bautzen, and then again at Dresden. But these are not the complete victories his desperate situation demands. Small defeats of his Generals (Oudinot on August 23rd at Grossbeeren, Mcdonald on August 26th at Katzbach, Vandamme on August 29-30th at Kulm and Ney on September 6th at Dennewitz) brought the strength to decline...<br/><br/>Now, with his strength sapped, Napoleon recoils to Leipzig. Like wolves, his enemies surround the place and converge. . . . Napoleon at Leipzig 3rd Edition retains its classic starting situation with only one wing of the French Army on the map. Later, Napoleon leads the main body of La Grande Arm&eacute;e, 175,000 strong, into a position which Marshal Marmont later described as lying &quot;at the bottom of a funnel.&quot; As 300,000 Allied troops converge on Leipzig during the succeeding days, the French task is to crush one or more of the enemy armies, or successfully retire the cream of their army across the sole remaining bridge spanning the Elster.<br/><br/>Scenarios and the Campaign Game can begin on the 14th, 16th, or 18th of October, 1813. The Standard, Campaign and Grand Tactical rules have been completely revised to reflect the latest findings in Napoleonic scholarship.<br/><br/>A totally new map, based on fresh sources, accurately portrays the terrain around Leipzig, emphasizing the superb cavalry terrain to the south. A Study Folder with the classic narrative by noted author F. Lorraine Petrie, along with the Order of Battle and set-up for the three stages of the six-day battle, is also included.<br/><br/>The game has 4 editions.  <br/>The first one was produced by Kevin Zucker's own &quot;Operational Studies Group&quot; company.  <br/>Later 3 more editions had been published, all by Clash of Arms (comments to the different editions had been made by Ed Wimble): <br/>- [2ed] 1988 - new counters. Map &amp; box uses old negatives but with a different color scheme and paper. Rules pretty much the same with a flourish here and there (such as the added steps for the Guard counters).<br/>- [3ed] 1992 - this was certainly just a reprint, as there was no new copyright for it<br/>- [4ed] 1996 - new map and artwork based on Ed Wimble's visit of Leipzig. New box and artwork. New rules: Kevin Zucker redesigned them. Counters: The half sheet reworked.<br/><br/>Thereafter GMT proclaimed a combined GMT-OSG 5ed for a P-500. <br/>In 2012 Kevin Zucker announced that the 5th Edition will now be a sole OSG product and should see publication in 2012/ 2013. <br/>Note: the 5th Edition can be found here: Napoleon at Leipzig (Fifth Edition)<br/><br/>GAME SYSTEM: <br/>Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the &quot;Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB-)Series&quot; <br/>- scale = 480m/hex, <br/>- time = 1hour/GT,<br/>- strength = 500-800 men/SP.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1-3 hours<br/>Hex: 525 yards / 480 meters<br/>Units: Battery to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory (Operational Studies Group version):<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; 6-color mapsheets<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters - 90 of which are blanks)<br/>One 8-page Napoleon at Leipzig rules booklet<br/>One 32-page Napoleon at Leipzig study folder booklet<br/>One side-printed errata  card<br/>One 6-sided die<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-6 Hours<br/><br/>",

Small war parties often acted according to their own will rather than following orders from &ldquo;commanding officers.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game includes two decks of opportunity cards.  Each player starts the game with one card and, while the Indian player can &ldquo;earn&rdquo; one more by actions taken in the game, the American player may use momentum to &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; additional cards throughout the game.<br/><br/>Pre-game Indian Enhancement and limited American intelligence help provide play balance to an outnumbered Indian army.  Optional Indian reinforcements are also available.<br/><br/>Newtown also includes rules for Indian honor, resolve under artillery fire, ferocity and evasion.<br/><br/>In Oriskany, the Indian player&rsquo;s secret pre-game selection of the ambush hex and the American player&rsquo;s turn-by-turn choice for Herkimer&rsquo;s rate of march will have profound effect on the course of play.  Proximity to Ft. Stanwix is not the only thing that must be taken into account.  If the column is ambushed while moving at an accelerated rate the ambushing Indians receive advantages.  On the other hand, if Herkimer approaches cautiously he can better defend against an ambush but risks losing army morale for progressing too slowly with the rescue effort.<br/><br/>Herkimer&rsquo;s Tryon County Militia is made up of special 2-step, 1-strength point units permitting each unit to take a step loss and continue to fight.  This expedient is used to reflect the intensity of the fighting that occurred between the two forces.  Militia at Oriskany fought like veteran line units, giving and asking no quarter, for nearly six straight hours.<br/><br/>Oriskany also includes pre and post-ambush Sequences of Play and rules for laagering and limbering the American supply wagons, looting, detaching American garrison artillery and the possibility of storms.<br/><br/>2 errata counters are included in C3i #27 (2013)<br/><br/>',

        description: "During the night of 5-6 june 1944, the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were to be parachuted behind Utah Beach in order to secure the approaches to the beach for the first wave of the landing forces. The sector had been flooded by the Germans, transforming streams and lowlands into swamps and increasing the strategic value of the bridges and roads of the region. Of these, the two bridges located in the commune of Chef-du-Pont and the crossroads of Sainte-M&egrave;re-Eglise are of primary importance for the Allies. In fact, withouth capturing them, it would be impossible to advance quickly into the Cotentin Peninsula and enlarge the bridgehead.<br/><br/>The paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne need to be dropped onto three Drop Zones: The 505th PIR to the northwest of Sainte-M&egrave;re-Eglise, the 507th PIR to the north of Amfreville, and the 508th PIR to the south of Amfreville. The Americans did have some reservations about the chances of success of this airborne operation. The landing zones were surrounded by several swamps and the smallest error would lead to heavy losses. The most pessimistic predictions had the casualty rate at 80%.<br/><br/>While flying over the Cotentin, the troop transports were fired upon by German anti-aircraft defenses and thrown into disorder. Some pilots broke formation and gave the order to jump before the drop zones had been reached, leaving many parachutists dozens of kilometers away from their objectives. The less fortunate landed in the swampland and drowned in their heavy equipment. More than three-quarter of paratroopers did not land where they were supposed to, leading to the complete disorganization of the American troops dropped over France. This general state of disorder resulted in a series of clashes all over southeastern Cotentin. The Germans, themselves disorganized, limited their engagements against an enemy force whose objectives and strength remained unknown.<br/><br/>Despite an extremely high rate of losses (more than 50% during the night of 6 June 1944 alone), the American paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions accomplished a great deal of their assigned missions. The Germans, disorganized by the chaos, were incapable of counter-attacking. The landing could begin.<br/><br/>&quot;Night Drop&quot; simulates the first hours of June 1944 and focuses on the operations conducted by the 82nd Us Airborne division. During the first (night time) game turns, the American player had to regroup his scattered forces in order to re-form companies and regiments. As long as this reorganization remains undone, American troops remain very vulnerable and the American player cannot know which objectives are in priority.<br/><br/>The German player can use the opportunity to create even more disorder in the American ranks, or chase after isolated paratroopers. But the surprise of the airborne assault keeps the Germans blind to the objectives of their adversaries. As daylight comes, the German player slowly begins to learn the intentions of the American troops and can better organize as reinforcements arrive.<br/><br/>For the American player, the knowledge of his objectives and the strength of his units give him the advantage over his enemies. The superiority from which he benefits allows him to bluff his opponent by attacking lesser important objectives, obliging the German player to make some critical choices: continue to defend a hex of middling importance and risk abandoning a more important hex, or focus on defending more important hexes and risk having been &quot;fooled&quot; by the enemy! The randomness of the drop, the priority assigned to each objective, and the arrival of German reinforcements assures a different game each time.<br/><br/>140 counters<br/>17&quot; x 22&quot; map<br/>6 pages rules booklet<br/><br/>Scale: 1 counter = 1 American company or 1 German section/company<br/>1 game turn = 1 hour<br/>1 hex = 400 meters<br/><br/>(source: publisher's description)<br/><br/>",

        description: "No Prisoners is a wargame covering the Suez-Palestine-Arabian Theater of Operations during World War I. That theater saw two major campaigns: one in which the forces of the British Empire contested control of the vital Suez Canal and Jerusalem regions with the Ottoman Turks and their German allies; and the Arab Revolt, in which Thomas E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) took a leading role. Both campaigns featured several of the major mobile actions of the Great War. At stake was nothing less than control of the entire Middle East.<br/><br/>The game has two players: the Allies (British and Arab Rebels) and Central Powers (Ottoman Turks and Germans). Players move and attack with their units in their own discrete turns. The objective is to capture critical cities and thereby win the war in this theater. The game map is divided into two theaters, the Western and Eastern, in which separate campaigns are conducted.<br/><br/>No Prisoners also includes an optional alternative command system, in which both players control opposing British and Central Powers units in the two map sectors, in the same manner as in old-SPI's classic Battle for Germany game. In that option, the two maps' Allied forces race against each other for victory.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map equals 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) across, and each game turn represents three months of operations. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily regiments, brigades and divisions. There are 176 large-size (5/8&quot;) NATO-style (and some iconic) unit-counters in the game.<br/><br/>",

        description: "from MMP's website:<br/><br/>In September of 1862 after months of uninterrupted and spectacular successes, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virgina was poised to win the war.<br/><br/>Lee has beaten back McClellan's Army of the Potomac from the gates of Richmond, routed Pope's Army of Virginia, and built a reputation of invincibility.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lincoln had already penned the Emancipation Proclamation which would recast the war from one of a political disagreement over Federal control to a moral crusade which just could not be argued away. He just needed a victory to cast the entire war in an a new strategic light.<br/><br/>All could very well be decided by what happens in the western part of Maryland over a few days.<br/><br/>McClellan fought Lee's army back to the banks of the Antietam creek near the town of Sharpsburg. There both armies stood to fight the bloodiest single day battle in American history. The final decision is in your hands.<br/><br/>None but Heroes is a game about that terrible day. Players tackle each other head-on. Can you do better than McClellan? Can you fight McClellan off like Lee? The stakes couldn't be higher!<br/><br/>None but Heroes is the first game in the new Line of Battle Series. While drawing on the lessons of over 20 years of ACW design work of its two ancestor series, LoB represents the next generation of ACW game design. No stone was left unturned in making this system the best gaming experience possible. All the unit rosters and paperwork that interfered with the fighting is gone. The typical (and time consuming) multiple fire phases have all been integrated into movement so the action is non-stop.<br/><br/>For the first time, the rat fight feel of the ACW open battlefield comes alive. The historical units (generally regiments of infantry and batteries of cannon) actually show the combined arms interactions and tactics available at the time. Old hands will see the history in a new light as they explore the implications of more recent research.<br/><br/>Representing many years of original research, the game contains information not available anywhere else regarding the strength, equipment, location, capabilities, and order of battle of both armies. Extensive historical notes layout just some of the myriad of details included in the units, scenarios, and map.<br/><br/>As one small example, it explores the frequently overlooked &quot;Green&quot; units at the battle (units which have been in the army for a few weeks or even less). The Green units will make you look at McClellan's strength in a whole new way. This is a level of &quot;greenness&quot; well beyond the usual sense of &quot;not having been in combat, yet&quot;. These are enthusiastic men, but some of whom have not yet been taught to load their muskets.<br/><br/>The Union player is only mildly inhibited by his McClellan persona; you can try a lot of different approaches to cutting the Rebels down to size. You are equipped with the same heavy guns and infantry with just as much grit and determination as he was.<br/><br/>The Confederate player will need to use his thin forces wisely, but cannot fail to counterattack as needed to blunt Union advances. You must use your troop's elan to make up for their limited numbers.<br/><br/>The game features four two-map scenarios which allow players to pick up the action at various times during the day and the morning of the next. The ability to start play the day after the battle allows players a chance to explore the options available on that day. Each of the other three scenarios can alternatively be played as a two day campaign game.<br/><br/>In addition to the large scenarios above, there are four smaller scenarios involving only portions of one map. One is a very short learning scenario showing the charge of Hood's Texans into the Cornfield. The other three isolate key actions of the battle: The complete Cornfield fight, the Battle for the Sunken Road, and the final attack by Burnside to take Sharpsburg and the counterattack by A.P. Hill's Division.<br/><br/>",

        description: "&quot;June 3. Cold Harbor. I was killed.&quot;<br/><br/>Thus read the last diary entry, found in the pocket of a dead Union soldier. He had made the entry himself, while all around him, other soldiers were writing names and home addresses on slips of paper and pinning them to the back of their coats.<br/><br/>These veteran soldiers knew what was coming, although it seems their commanders did not. Three full corps launched a disjointed attack against well-entrenched Confederates. In just eight minutes, the attack had petered out. Over 7000 Federals covered the Virginia soil. A few minutes later, the orders came down to renew the attacks, but at each level, from corps commander to captain, the orders were &quot;followed&quot; only by increased firing -- most of it blindly -- while remaining in position.<br/><br/>Grant said, &quot;I regret this assault more than any one I ever ordered.&quot; Today it sounds more like WWI madness than part of Grant's successful campaign to end the Civil War.<br/><br/>But it was not so easy on the other side. While one CSA staffer called it &quot;perhaps the easiest victory ever granted to Confederate arms by the folly of Federal commanders,&quot; from Lee's point of view, anything could happen. His army had &quot;not a regiment&quot; in reserve, and the volume of sound -- &quot;It seemed more like a volcanic blast than a battle,&quot; -- rattled windows all the way back in Richmond.<br/><br/>Not War But Murder covers the week-long operation which marked the end of Grant's 30 day, &quot;smash 'em up&quot; campaign begun at Wilderness. Like a bloody chess match, Grant and Lee made move and counter move to get to this point, with Lee well aware that a false move could end the war quickly.<br/><br/>Not War But Murder, by designer Michael Rinella, is his newest area-map game, and his first take on an American Civil War battle. This game includes one 22&quot; by 34&quot; inch area map, 176 5/8&quot; counters, and 16 pages of rules and charts that include extensive examples of play, designer notes, and variant rules. It also marks the debut of what Rinella calls the &quot;diceless advantage&quot;. In previous area-impulse games, from Monty's Gamble all the way to the Avalon Hill games of the early 1990s, an &quot;advantage chit&quot; allowed the person holding it to re-roll an single die roll (or rolls if it was a combat). In NWBM this changes. The player may spend the advantage to gain specific game benefits, automatically. Thus, rather than being hoarded, this &quot;twist of fate&quot; is likely to hop back and forth, as each player strives to save a desperate situation.<br/><br/>What is most amazing about NWBM is how much of a &quot;game&quot; it actually is, offering both players challenges and fateful decisions to make, in this classic face-off of well-known leadership. What will you do?<br/><br/>",

        description: 'Nothing Gained But Glory will be the fifth volume from the award winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series. It features several pivotal battles in Baltic region of the late 17th century - a period where rulers struggled to centralize power in their realms and to introduce permanent standing armies instead of expensive mercenary forces. It shows the highly trained and well led army of Sweden struggling to defend its massive gains from the Thirty Years War and the Northern Wars of 1655-1661 against the forces of Denmark and Brandenburg, reinforced by contingents from Austria, the United Provinces, M&uuml;nster, Hesse-Kassel and Poland.<br/><br/>The personalities in the game include the great Swedish warrior king Carl XI, Brandenburg&acute;s Frederick William (the Great Elector), and King Christian V of Denmark-Norway. Never before have so many monarchs been in one M&amp;P box!<br/><br/>Nearly all the scenarios in this module are smaller than the typical Musket &amp; Pike scenarios, and thus take less time and space to play. For the same reasons it is a great introductory game to the series.<br/><br/>The Historical Background<br/><br/>The Scanian War was prompted by the Franco-Dutch War of 1672-1678. Sweden had allied with France against several European countries, and was eventually forced to fulfill her treaty obligations to France by invading Brandenburg. This invasion was an attempt to force Brandenburg to withdraw from the fighting against France, but the invasion was conducted without the usual energy and force of previous Swedish offensives. When the Brandenburg Army returned home much faster than anticipated the Swedes started to withdraw, but were caught by the Brandenburgers and defeated at the battle of Fehrbellin on June 28th 1675. The previously &quot;unbeatable&quot; Swedish Army had lost a battle, and this key event soon persuaded others to join the war.<br/><br/>Most notable of these was Denmark, which saw its chance to regain the Scanian lands lost in the Northern Wars. (Scania is the southern tip of Sweden, just across the Oeresund, the Sound, from Denmark.) After mopping up the Swedish possessions of Wismar and Bremen, the Danish Army landed in Scania on June 29, 1676. Danish King Christian V led 15,000 troops against a defending Swedish Army of 5,000 men that were spread out over the province. Initially the operation was a great success. Large parts of the local peasantry sided with Denmark and the outnumbered Swedish troops were in bad shape. Town after town fell into the hands of the Danes and the Swedes had to retreat north to Sweden proper. After a month only the fortified town of Malm&ouml; remained under Swedish control. At sea the situation wasn&acute;t any better for the Swedes, as their navy lost several battles against the combined Danish- Dutch Navy, and left the command of the sea in the hands of the allies.<br/><br/>Two factors helped to save Sweden from ruin: the splendid courage of their young king who resolutely and successfully kept the Danish invaders at bay, and the diplomatic activity of Louis XIV, the French king.<br/><br/>The first ray of light for the Swedish cause came with the battle of Halmstad in August 1675 when the king succeeded in outmaneuvering and destroying a small Danish force sent north to take Halmstad and link up with the forces operating out from Norway. As the Swedish Army slowly grew larger it became possible to meet the Danish main army head on, and the Swedes were victorious at the battles of Lund in December 1676 and Landskrona in June 1677. These battles caused the fighting to stalemate on the Scanian front, as the Danish could supply and reinforce their coastal fortresses by sea, but didn&acute;t dare venture inland to meet the Swedish Army in a field battle again.<br/><br/>The focus of the war therefore shifted to the German front once again, where the Brandenburg Army was slowly conquering the Swedish fortresses and fortified cities one by one. The Danish Army sent an expeditionary force to the island of R&uuml;gen and captured it, but lost it again in January 1678 after a winter of horrid attrition, when the Swedes returned to the island once more and defeated them in the battle of Warksow. Later in 1678 the Allies would take R&uuml;gen once more, and eventually all the Swedish possessions in Germany were lost.<br/><br/>Events in Western Europe would once again have far reaching effects on the Baltic as the end of the Franco-Dutch war in 1678 gave France the power to force an end to the Scanian War and dictate the peace treaties of Fontainebleau. These treaties restored almost all the Swedish possessions lost during the war, and so the end result was truly &ldquo;Nothing Gained but Glory.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The 7 battles included in Nothing Gained but Glory are:<br/><br/>Nyborg, November 14, 1659 - (While not part of the Scanian War, this bonus battle from the Northern War of 1655-1660 features many of the same participants.) The Swedes had occupied the Danish island of F&uuml;nen, but following the landings of two Allied forces and their subsequent combination the Swedes had to fight to win time for an evacuation from the island. With no more room to retreat and the port town of Nyborg&acute;s fortifications in a sorry state, the 7,000 strong Swedish Army positioned itself in good defensive terrain between a lake and a forest. While command difficulties in the 11,000 strong Allied Army almost cost them the battle, the Allies eventually prevailed, forcing the Swedish Army to flee to Nyborg, where it surrendered the next day.<br/><br/>Fehrbellin, June 28, 1675 - Returning from fighting against France to face the Swedish invasion, the highly mobile Brandenburg Army of 5,600 cavalry and 13 guns faced a retreating Swedish Army of 7,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 7 guns outside the town of Fehrbellin. A poor deployment of the Swedish Army combined with aggressive handling of the Brandenburg cavalry forced the Swedes from the field. Although the losses in the battle were about equal, the Swedish Army was severely reduced by the subsequent pursuit, raiding peasant guerilla, desertion, and starvation. While only of minor importance militarily, the victory had an enormous psychological impact: the Swedes, long considered &quot;unbeatable&quot;, had been bested. With the myth of Swedish invincibility broken, Denmark decided the time was right to settle its scores with Sweden and entered the war. Frederick William henceforth was known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot; and the army that he and Derfflinger had led to victory became the core of the future famous Prussian Army.<br/><br/>Halmstad, August 17, 1676 - After the initial great successes for the Danish forces following the landings in Scania in late June 1676, a small Danish force of 3,500 men under Jacob Duncan was detached from the main army and ordered to advance north to take the town of Halmstad and if possible link up with the Norwegian forces under General Gyldenl&oslash;ve. Sensing the possibility of destroying the unsupported Danish detachment, the Swedish king reacted and by heavy force marching succeeded in cutting off Duncan from his line of communications, forcing him to fight his way back. Duncan moved against the Swedes, but then went on the defensive. The Swedes took the initiative, collapsed both of the Danish flanks, and then overwhelmed the center, forcing the army to surrender. This battle ended the Danish plans of linking up with the Norwegians, and provided a much-needed boost to Swedish morale.<br/><br/>Lund, December 4, 1676 - This was the bloodiest battle in the history of Scandinavia, with almost 9,000 killed (out of 12,000 Danes and 8,000 Swedes) after an intense day-long battle fought in the chilling cold of the Scandinavian winter. After a cross-river standoff that lasted for a month, the Swedes attacked when the river froze. The Swedes initially had the advantage, and their right wing (along with the king) routed the Danish left and pursued it off the field. The rest of the Swedish Army was then outnumbered, and just as they were about to succumb, the king and part of his wing showed up in the Danish rear, saving the battle for the Swedes.<br/><br/>Malm&ouml;, June 25-26, 1677 - Malm&ouml;, the regional capital of Scania, was the only major town that didn&acute;t fall during the 1676 Danish offensive, and had been a thorn in the Danish side ever since. In June 1677 the Danes decided to take the town by besieging it.<br/>When news arrived that the Swedish Navy had set sail to break the blockade of the town and that the Swedish Army was moving to relieve the town, the Danes decided to force the issue and storm the town, even though the siege hadn&acute;t progressed very far. On the Swedish side, the town commander Fabian Fersen prepared his 2,300 strong garrison well, and they fought with desperate courage as they knew it was victory or death. While the Danes were able to scale the wall and break into the city, a determined Swedish counterattack destroyed them before they could open the gates for more Danish troops.<br/>(This is a medium sized battle on a half map with various special rules to reflect the many special circumstances of storming a fortified town at night.)<br/><br/>Landskrona, July 14, 1677 - After the defeat of the Danish Army at Malm&ouml;, the Swedish king decided the time was right to attack them before they could be reinforced by their German and Austrian allies. He thus moved his 10,000 regulars and 4,000 peasant militia towards the Danish Army located at Landskrona. However, the Danes had received their reinforcements that replenished their numbers to 14,000, and the Danish king felt confident about fighting a field battle. This was a hard-fought battle which saw both armies experimenting with combined arms wings and the personal involvement of the monarchs of both armies.<br/><br/>Warksow, January 18, 1678 - As the war had reached a stalemate on the Scanian front the Danish forces invaded the island of R&uuml;gen in the fall of 1677. They quickly conquered most of the island except for a small Swedish fortified bridgehead. As supplies ran low and attrition ravaged the army, large parts of the Danish expedition were withdrawn from the island, leaving just under 5,000 men. This allowed the Swedes to transfer 3,500 men from their field army in Germany to the remaining bridgehead in early January 1678 and try to take back the island. The armies met at Warksow, where a Swedish cannonade killed the commander of the Danish Army, paralyzing it. Most of the Danish expeditionary force was captured during the battle or in the aftermath as the Swedes quickly cleared R&uuml;gen.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>1 series rulebook<br/>1 playbook<br/>3 countersheets<br/>2 2.5 map sheets, 2 of which are backprinted<br/>1 10-sided die<br/>3 Player Aid Cards<br/><br/>',

        description: "&quot;NUTS! The Battle of the Bulge&quot; is a card wargame for 2-4 players recreating the famous World War II battle in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region, hoping to break through to the English Channel and split the Allied Forces.  Each player controls either the German or the U.S. and British forces.  Players draw cards in each daily turn from their own decks, then play the cards as they see fit.  Many cards can be played during the opponent's turn so there is constant interaction.  Each deck is complete; there are no cards to collect or trade.  NUTS! comes in two 150-card sets (North and South).  Each set is complete and can be played on its own, or the two sets can be played together.  (From the back of the box by Decision Games)<br/><br/>The cards have actual photographs of units, events, cities, and equipment from the battle.  Cards comprise of units (infantry, artillery, mechanized), events like bad weather or supply drops, and terrain to include cities, major forest, rivers, and ridges.  Units are rated in strength values for infantry, armor, artillery, and cohesion.  The objectives are for the Germans to get three panzer units (six if playing both decks) from their start side off the Allied side of the board.  The Allies must prevent this and stall the offensive until adequate reinforcement arrival.  Although this is a card game, it plays very much like a board game.  Battles are resolved via dice rolling.  The rules do include important factors such as supply, town encirclement, weather, blitzes, cohesion checks, and the like.  Overall, an easy to medium game to grasp the rules and play.  (comments by Walt Mulder)<br/><br/>",

The German Player is on the offensive, attempting to win the game by eliminating or isolating British units and seizing key terrain on the map.  The British Player is on the defensive, first attempting to prevent the German player from achieving that side's objectives, then escaping off the map with the bulk of the BEF still intact.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents approximately one mile from side to opposite side.  Each game turn equals about two hours.  The units of maneuver in the game are mostly regiments for the Germans and battalions for the British.  Each full-strength German infantry regiment contained some 4,000 men and three-dozen cannon; each full-strength British battalion had some 2,000 men and 18 cannon.<br/><br/>Since this battle was fought over only two days, and both sides' forces entered pretty much fully supplied, there are no supply rules.  Similarly, there are no replacements.  And finally, there are no concentric assault rules, since the British were too proud to become scared when they were surrounded, and the Germans wer too inexperienced to know they should be scared when they were surrounded.<br/><br/>(from section 1.0 of Rules)<br/><br/>",

        description: "Olustee, is a simulation about The Battle of Olustee was fought on February 20, 1864, during the American Civil War. It was the only major battle fought in Florida during the war.<br/><br/>Union General Truman Seymour had landed troops at Jacksonville, aiming chiefly to disrupt Confederate food supply. Meeting little resistance, he proceeded towards the state capital of Tallahassee, against orders, assuming that he would face only the small Florida militia. Confederates in Charleston sent reinforcements under General Alfred H. Colquitt and the two armies collided near Olustee Station. The Union forces were repulsed and retreated to Jacksonville where they stayed for the remainder of the war.<br/><br/>Following the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad, Seymour led his 5,500 men in the direction of Lake City. At approximately 2:30 in the afternoon of February 20, the Union force approached General Finnegan's 5,000 Confederates entrenched near Olustee Station. Finnegan sent out an infantry brigade to meet Seymour's advance units and lure them into the Confederate entrenchments, but this plan went awry. The opposing forces met at Ocean Pond and the battle began. Seymour made the mistake of assuming he was once again facing Florida militia units he had previously routed with ease and committed his troops piecemeal into the battle. Finnegan and Seymour both reinforced their engaged units during the afternoon and the battle took place in open pine woods. The Union forces attacked but were savagely repulsed by withering barrages of rifle and cannon fire.<br/><br/>The battle raged throughout the afternoon until, as Finnegan committed the last of his reserves, the Union line broke and began to retreat. Finnegan did not exploit the retreat, allowing most of the fleeing Union forces to reach Jacksonville. However, the Confederates did make a final attempt to engage the rear element of Seymour's forces just before nightfall, but they were repulsed by elements of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 35th United States Colored Troops, both composed of black soldiers. The Confederate cavalry commander received criticism for failing to pursue the retreating Union forces.<br/><br/>Uses a slightly modified version of SPI's Blue &amp; Gray rules, called Battles of the American Civil War that started with Seven Days Battles.<br/><br/>Originally published by Decision Games (I) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #166, along with Savage Station.<br/><br/>Note: Some replacement counters for this game, and the rules necessary to use them, were included in S&amp;T 170: Atlanta Campaign.

With Olympos, coming from French publisher Ystari Games, Keyaerts has another go at the simplified civilization game. The playing time for Olympos is only 60-90 minutes for 2-5 players, but says Ystari's Cyril Demaegd, &quot;Even if it's a short game, it's a gamer's game.&quot;<br/><br/>Players take actions based on their position on a time track, along the lines of Peter Prinz' Thebes. (Says Demaegd, &quot;This is mainly a coincidence because Philippe designed this game years ago.&quot;) By spending time, players take actions, with the choices being expansion or development. Expanding brings new settlers onto the game board, which depicts Greece and Atlantis, which lets you conquer territories and thereby acquire resources.<br/><br/>Development takes place on the game's discovery board, with players either buying new scientific discoveries &ndash; such as medicine or phalanxes &ndash; or building architectural wonders. Each discovery brings you new powers, such as an upgrade in military strength due to the phalanx, and each wonder earns you points.<br/><br/>A player's piety is measured by discoveries, and the most pious player might be rewarded during the game by one of the nine gods included. Similarly, the less pious players might be punished by those same gods.<br/><br/>The replayability of Olympos is huge, says Demaegd, as the discovery board and gods in play will be different each game, not to mention the territories you're able to conquer.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Wargame based around the WW2 Western Allied campaign from just after the Normandy invasion to the crossing of the Rhine.<br/><br/>First significant mechanic is the unpredictable turn order - players dice for each turn, with the highest taking the turn. However, ties end that month's play (players draw fresh supply points each month, and the game ends after 20 months).<br/><br/>Second significant mechanic is the use of (limited) supply points to activate stacks of units when it's your turn. Like games such as We the People/Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage/Rommel in the Desert/Napoleon, you don't have the resources to activate all of your units each turn, you need to decide what the current priority is in line with the current situation. Activation generally allows you to either move stacks or attack with stacks, but with an increased expenditure of supply points, you can take more powerful 'breakthrough' turns involving both movement and attack.<br/><br/>These mechanics (unpredictable turn order, limited ability to activate units each turn) create a game of fluid tactical situations, where your planning has to be flexible - you never know who will get the next turn.<br/><br/>The Allied player has to break out of the beach head and capture additional supply ports (which raise the number of supply points available to the Allies, and hence the number of activations possible) en route to Germany. The German player must contain the Allies in Normandy for as long as possible before falling back to the Rhine, while also denying the valuable supply ports to the Allies as long as possible. The Allies are up against a tight timetable; the Germans must work against as increasing disadvantage in supply points.<br/><br/>Victory is generally determined by the difference in numbers between German units West of the Rhine and Allied units East of the Rhine at game end. Allied paratroops, the German Bulge offensive, reinforcements/replacements and strategic movement add to the game. The big mounted map with large hexes and counters remove the 'fiddle factor' which can blight wargames with lower production values.<br/><br/>Republished in Command Magazine Japan #64 in 2005.<br/><br/>",

This game was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #153, along with Zama.<br/><br/>Operation Felix is a &quot;what if...&quot; game on the invasion of Gibraltar by the Germans in 1940/41, shortly after the fall of France. Historically, it was the option Hitler elected against, putting political calculations ahead of military realities in his attempt to dominate Europe. This recasting of history assumes that Hitler made the defeat of Britain his top priority in 1940-41. Instead of angling for negotiations with His Majesty's government after Dunkirk, The Fuhrer issues orders to German High Command to take the war to the Commonwealth wherever it could. The one obvious target that is close at hand, and has considerable military and political value, is the Rock of Gibraltar, the gateway to the western Mediterranean Sea.<br/><br/>Scenarios cover a July 1940 attack, the more probable December 1940 invasion, and a Spanish assault (with a little help from German allies). Optional rules for SS reinforcements and greater German amphibious capacity.<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/>hex scale = 250 meters/hex side to side <br/>time = one day per game turn <br/>strength = platoon/company/battalion sized units<br/><br/>",

        description: 'Portrays the disastrous Commonwealth raid against the German-held French port city of Dieppe in 1942. The game uses a simplified version of the D-Day at Omaha Beach system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from Publisher website :)Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942 (OJ) is a purpose-designed solitaire game, by John Butterfield, simulating the disastrous Commonwealth raid against the German-held French port of Dieppe on 19 August 1942. It uses an evolution of his well-liked system from our earlier boxed game release: D-Day on Omaha Beach.<br/>Historically, a mixed force of Canadian troops and tanks and British Commandos landed on several beaches along a 16-mile stretch of coast, with a variety of objectives. While the commando raids on the flanks met with some success, the major action against Dieppe was a costly failure. It didn&rsquo;t come close to achieving its objectives, and over 75 percent of that landing force were killed or captured. You control the CW forces assaulting the beaches and struggling to achieve their objectives against intense German resistance. The game system controls the German forces that oppose you.<br/><br/>The overall 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map, which is cut in half and reassembled into a 17&quot;x42&quot; play area, consists of three sector maps: the main map showing the French port of Dieppe and surrounding areas, and two smaller maps portraying coastal areas east and west of the main map. The main map is divided into four areas: Blue Beach, Dieppe town, Green Beach and Rear. Each hex represents 400 meters (438 yards) across; each game turn equals 20 minutes. Units of maneuver are companies and batteries; there are 176 large-size NATO-style and iconic counters in the mix.<br/> Rules cover such things as: coastal battery fire, random events, unit depth, command-control and communication, air attack, &ldquo;what if&rdquo; variants, amphibious warfare and much more. The game can be completed in about three to four hours. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>I. CW Amphibious Transport Phase<br/>1. Unit Transport<br/>2. Landing Check<br/>II. Operations Phase<br/>III. Commonwealth Action Phase<br/>1. Beach Landings or Evacuation.<br/>2. CW Actions<br/>3. Recovery<br/>IV. End of Turn Phase<br/><br/>',

        description: 'From the publisher:<br/><br/>Early in the morning on 20 May 1941, as 30,000 Commonwealth soldiers on Crete were finishing breakfast, hundreds of German transport aircraft&mdash;some towing gliders&mdash;rumbled over the Mediterranean island. The air above was suddenly filled with parachutes as thousands of elite German paratroops&mdash;Fallschirmj&auml;ger&mdash;descended from the sky.<br/><br/>The invasion of Crete was one of the most dramatic battles of the Second World War. Over a nine-day period in May 1941, a mixed force of Commonwealth and Greek troops desperately tried to fight off the German assault. Despite appalling casualties, the paratroopers and glider-borne troops managed to secure a foothold and the critical Maleme Airfield to open the door for the German Gebirgsj&auml;ger (mountain troops) to land under fire. Together the Fallschirmj&auml;ger and Gebirgsj&auml;ger pushed the Commonwealth troops to their breaking point and forced a deadly battle of delay and pursuit.<br/><br/>This was a true soldier&rsquo;s battle, with both sides in desperate situations often lacking higher-level control and support. The Germans had to quickly secure a usable airfield or face the annihilation of their entire airborne force. The Commonwealth needed to crush the German landings or&mdash;failing that&mdash;evacuate the bulk of its forces to continue the fight in North Africa and Syria.<br/><br/>The German invasion of Crete in May 1941 stands as a landmark in the history of airborne warfare. Up until that point, airborne operations were tactical operations to seize key objectives in advance of the ground forces. The German invasion of Crete (codenamed Operation Merkur) was the first strategic airborne operation.<br/><br/>Although casualties would mean Crete was the last hurrah for the German airborne in a major air assault, it set the stage for even larger future Allied airborne operations in the Mediterranean, Western Europe, and Asia.<br/><br/>Operation Mercury maintains the same level of detail and scale as other Grand Tactical Series (GTS) games. Players command divisions and maneuver company-sized units to fight one of the most desperate battles of the war. Using the GTS 2.0 rules, Operation Mercury offers two players or teams a wide range of scenarios ranging from a single small map with a few units on each side to the full battle including up to two German divisions and several Commonwealth and Greek brigades. Operation Mercury covers all the major airdrops and fighting across the island from Heraklion in the east, through Rethymnon, and from Maleme to Suda Bay then south to the Askifou Plain, scene of the last major fight during the withdrawal.<br/><br/>As the Commander of Allied forces on Crete, can you deny the Germans a precious airfield and negate their much-needed air-landing reinforcements for a quick victory? Of all operations of war, a withdrawal under heavy enemy pressure is probably the most difficult and perilous. Can you get the bulk of your forces to the southern evacuation ports? As the German, how quickly can you force the collapse of the Commonwealth morale and trigger their withdrawal?<br/><br/>Features include:<br/><br/><br/>     Shifting Allied morale state based on relative casualties and key events, which can trigger evacuation and end-game victory conditions.<br/>     Random events, including tank breakdowns, misdirected airstrikes, and partisan attacks.<br/>     An option for Commonwealth naval support at the risk of losing precious ships to German air attacks.<br/><br/><br/>Thirteen scenarios include:<br/><br/>     Separate one-map battles for the airdrops at Rethymnon, Heraklion, and the Maleme/Canea sector.<br/>     A one-map battle for the New Zealand counter-attack to retake Maleme airfield.<br/>     One-, two-, and three-map battles for the difficult German advance and Commonwealth delay and withdrawal.<br/>     The full campaign on all five maps or just the main event from Maleme to Askifou Plain on three maps.<br/>     Hypothetical German precision drops as well as a German free drop scenario.<br/><br/><br/>',

        description: 'Operation Shoestring: The Guadalcanal Campaign, 1942, is a game covering the air, land, and sea battles between the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps and the forces of the Japanese Empire on and around Guadalcanal Island in 1942. The unit scale is company-level for the ground game and squadron-level for the air forces. Naval counters represent one ship for carriers and battleships, two ships for cruisers, and destroyer flotillas.<br/><br/>&quot;We struck at Guadalcanal to halt the advance of the Japanese. We did not know how strong he was, nor did we know his plans. We knew only that he was moving down the island chain and that he had to be stopped ... From that moment in 1942, the tide turned, and the Japanese never again advanced.&quot; -- Maj. Gen. Alexander A. Vandegrift, USMC, Commanding General, 1st Marine Division<br/><br/>The strategic situation at the time found both sides relatively equal in strength for one of the few times in the war. After the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and the ensuing string of rapid conquests, Japanese fortunes had taken a turn for the worse. At the Battle of Coral Sea, American carrier-based air power fought to a draw with the vaunted Japanese, serving notice that the Japanese would not be allowed to project naval power with impunity. Later, the Battle of Midway saw four Japanese carriers sunk, evening the odds in the Pacific and laying the groundwork for the first American offensive of the Pacific War.<br/><br/>The Japanese, having been blunted at Midway, turned their attention to the south, extending a siring of bases southeast through the Solomons chain. They established a seaplane base at Tulagi, and began construction of a large airfield on the island of Guadalcanal. Air pow- er based at these airfields would be able to effectively threaten American supply lines between the west coast and Australia. Shocked by the news of the Japanese airfield construction in the Solomons, the American high command gathered all available marine forces for a strike at Guadalcanal. The main force was the American First Marine Division assembled at Wellington, New Zealand. This Division, understrength and less than half trained, would bear the brunt of driving the Japanese from Guadalcanal.<br/><br/>As the morning of August 7, 1942 dawned, weeks of boredom for the Marines and occasional skirmishes for the air forces were replaced by real battle. The Marines went ashore, first at Tulagi, then Guadalcanal, and finally at Gavutu/Tanambago. The Japanese, caught unprepared by the audacious amphibious assaults, nevertheless recovered quickly and sent air, land, and naval forces to Guadalcanal. The resulting clashes shaped the future of the war in the Pacific.<br/><br/>Operation Shoestring simulates this fascinating campaign &amp; includes special rules to simulate such unique aspects of the battle as: Innovative combat resolution, integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, shore bombardment, air support, and even Banzai charges into one easy-to-use system. Full-featured naval and air game that integrates with the island fighting. Engineers to rebuild airfields and construct improved positions. Japanese hidden units and limited U.S. intelligence.<br/><br/>Operation Shoestring can be played by one to four players. Solitaire play is possible with a slight modification to the naval rules, while team play is easily accommodated with one player commanding the ground forces and one the air and naval forces for each side. An introductory scenario, several short scenarios, and a grand campaign game allow players to experience the battle for Guadalcanal over a variety of time spans.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 3.5 days<br/>Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Army<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Operation Shoestring rulebook<br/>Six single-side printed player aid cards<br/>One 10-sided die<br/>One counter storage tray<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-30 depending on scenario<br/><br/>',

        description: "publisher's description<br/><br/>Battleground, North Africa, 26 May, 1941 - The recent Allied attack to relieve the Tobruk garrison, &quot;Operation Brevity,&quot; had been largely a failure. However, it left them in possession of the strategically important Halfaya Pass, the gateway to Egypt. In addition, British forces were harassing the German defenders with mobile columns to the South. German General Rommel recognized the need to recapture this terrain in order to stabilize the front. Still fearing the British infantry tank, Matilda, an under gunned, ponderous, mobile fortification, Rommel launched three panzer battalions plus supporting units to sweep the British from the field. The offensive was code named, &quot;Unternehmen Skorpion,&quot; ultimately known to the Allies as Operation Skorpion. The battle was brief and violent. Although there was a significant disparity in firepower, the Germans had a definite Achilles heel. Can the Germans accomplish their goals of capturing the Halfaya Pass and clearing its southern approaches before their supplies are exhausted, particularly the remainder of their fuel allotment?<br/><br/>Operation Skorpion is a relatively short, fast moving game that introduces a new fog of war game system. Opposing strength is unknown until units enter combat. Once revealed, those combat values can continue to fluctuate during the course of the game based on judicious use of mobile supply units, which can distribute and absorb Allocation Points. Although fighting a defensive battle, the British Player is not without counterattack capability. He will find his artillery arm, both direct and indirect fire, to be a potent force. Game rules such as: Combined Arms, HQ Coordinated Combat, Road Overrun, Engineers, and Reconnaissance Probe, all contribute to an appropriate sense of realism. Operation Skorpion provides exciting, tense, and balanced game play. Determining the ultimate winner often occurs on the last or next-to-the last game-turn. Turn back the clock to the heady days of Spring 1941 and command the Afrika Korps, or take on the British and ultimately break the sword of the Desert Fox, himself, in this battle game by Compass Games.<br/><br/>",

Planning for the operation began shortly after the failure of the Sinyavino Offensive. The German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad in late 1942 had weakened the German front. By January 1943, Soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across the entire German-Soviet front, especially in southern Russia, Iskra being the northern part of the wider Soviet 1942&ndash;1943 winter counter offensive<br/><br/>The city of Leningrad, second largest in the USSR, had been cut off by the Germans since September 8, 1941. Now, sixteen months later, the Soviets were about to make their third attempt to relieve the city. The first attack in January 1942 had led to the mauling of the 2nd Shock Army in the swamps to the south, and a second failure between Sinyavino and Mga in the summer of 1942 had also taken heavy casualties, although it had completely derailed von Manstein's planned assault on the city itself.

Game play is not confined to a game board, players gather their game pieces and get comfortable wherever they want to play! Teams of chefs are challenged by opposing teams of guests with trivia questions all about food. Players start with full plates and the winners are the first ones to Clean his Plate.<br/><br/>1. The starting chefs roll a 6-colored die.<br/>2. The next team in line (the guests), draw a card and ask the question matching the color that the chefs have rolled on the die. The timekeeper starts the sand timer once the question has been read and understood.<br/>3. If the chefs answer the question correctly, and before the timer runs out, then the chefs remove the matching color food chip from their &quot;plate&quot;. That &quot;food&quot; (chip) is now considered &quot;eaten&quot; and the chefs roll again. &quot;Eaten&quot; chips should be returned to the game box or set-aside. Used cards are returned to the card boxes. Chefs must continue to answer questions matching the color they roll, even if they have already &quot;eaten&quot; the chip for that color category.<br/>4. If the chefs give a wrong answer, then their turn is over, and play progresses in a clockwise direction to the next chefs in line.<br/>5. The first chefs to &quot;Clean Your Plate by &quot;eating&quot; all of their chips are the winners of DINNERTIME!<br/><br/>Over 40 recipes and party ideas are included so that the game can be played with edible game pieces in the game options; Play With Your Food, Potlucky, The Diet Plate Special and The Blue Plate Special.<br/><br/>There are also variant rules (including &quot;Seconds Dice&quot;, which let you challenge other players), and suggestions for using real food instead of tokens (including recipes).<br/><br/>",

That era saw the Ottomans go from a small nation competing for survival in the Near East to a regional superpower, forming a state that lasted until the end of the First World War. To build their empire, the Ottomans conquered the remnant of the Byzantine Empire, won smashing victories over other Islamic states and twice pushed to the gates of Vienna.<br/><br/>There are four factions in the game, each represented by a color: the Turks (Ottomans and others), the Holy League (mainly Catholic Europeans), the Orthodox (eastern Christians), and the Caliphate (a general term for the more established Islamic states). Within each faction there are individual nations. For example, the Turks include the Ottomans and the Seljuks.   Each player controls a &ldquo;core nationality&rdquo;; that is, one nationality within a faction of which he may never lose control. In the course of the game players may gain control of additional nationalities, some of which may be inimical to each other.<br/><br/>Ottomans is played in a series of turns. Within each game turn, players pick stratagem markers (which allow players to take certain political and military actions), move their forces and engage in combat. A player, while representing an individual faction, may control forces from other factions. Players will find themselves sometimes attacking forces they control, while perhaps temporarily aligning themselves with an opponent, in order to reach their final goals. Throughout each game turn, players may use stratagem markers to gain military and political advantages as well as to undermine their foes. Players receive reinforcements depending on which regions they control.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to build the strongest empire. At the end of the game, players check to see which faction won the game. The player who contributed the most to that faction&rsquo;s victory wins the game.<br/><br/>',

The French chief commander, Field Marshal Joffre, decided to make a stand south of the Marne River. The German, changing their initial Schlieffen Plan, attacked through the gap between Paris and the Allied left wing, further to the east. Their intent was to destroy the Allied armies in one grand battle of annihilation. But the plan went awry. The Germans had outrun their lines of communication, and it was difficult for them to replace their losses while the Allies, with their ever shortening lines of communication, quickly regained strength. At the critical moment, the French Paris Garrison counterattacked on the extended German right flank. The resulting conflagration caused the German to pull back.

Games in this volume include:<br/><br/>The Fall of Singapore is a simulation of one of the worst military defeats in British history. From December of 1941 to February of 1942, the campaign is a case study of a smaller but better-lead force of Japanese outmaneuvering a much larger but poorly trained and ill-led British.<br/><br/>Struggle on Bataan recreates the desperate U.S. and Filipino defense of the Bataan Peninsula between 9 January and 9 April 1942.  The defense of Bataan, though ultimately doomed, constituted the only serious disruption to the string of Japanese victories during the first six months of the war.<br/><br/>Turning Point: Guadalcanal is the struggle between the United States and Japan for possession of the island of Guadalcanal in the southern Solomons chain. The battle lasted from August 1942 until early February 1943.  The opponents on Guadalcanal were approximately of equal strength and with control of the seas around the island still to be decided, Guadalcanal was the last time in the war when an American amphibious operation faced the prospect of total defeat.<br/><br/>',

One would be fairly easy and the other extremely hard. Pelelieu became a vortex that took way more Marines lives than it was worth. The Japanese had dug themselves into the Umurbrogal Mountain and forced the battle to be drawn out for 2 months, instead of 2 weeks.<br/><br/>[From the publishers website]<br/>This is the fourth in the PIC series of games that simulate island battles in the Pacific Ocean Area during WWII. The game is a blend of operational/tactical level combat and maneuver during the taking of the islands of Pelelieu and Angaur from the Japanese during the Second World War. The game is played in turns, each one divided into phases for amphibious landing, maneuver, and combat. The game system uses many of the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) to simulate actual combat and maneuver that both the US and Japanese players must use to fight the battle. Of the seven BOS's, this simulation concentrates on Maneuver, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Air Defense, and Command and Control. The Japanese defenses are sophisticated and well manned with fanatical soldiers willing to die for their emperor. They fight so hard in fact that the Marines are stymied for much longer than planned and need to be releived by US Army troops from the 81st Division after they took Angaur.  The fight is bloody and sharp. Victory in the game is measured against the time and casualties it took the US forces to actually accomplish the same mission.<br/><br/>The game features US Marine Corps, US Army, US Navy, and Imperial Japanese forces at the Battalion, Company, and Platoon level. Units are initially setup as Battalions and Companies, and can be broken down into their respective elements. The combat system utilizes a set of combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. The Japanese player has the ability to conduct Banzai attacks at night and these cause considerable damage as the US player cannot fall back in front of these attacks and must take casualties.<br/><br/>The are a number of scenarios that simulate the battle on a smaller scale and allow for play for either island or both.  There will be numerous options that can be used to even play between players and make the fight more interesting.  These include additional Japanese forces that could have been there if they were not sunk by US submarines.<br/><br/>Game Design and Production by:    Chris Fasulo<br/><br/>Map Artwork:    Kyle Gebhardt<br/><br/>",

Although the Fresno Gaming Association was probably guilty of plagiarism in some of their game designs, their graphic presentation was always first class and this game is no exception.<br/><br/>The Island Battle of Saipan uses the system that FGA previously used in their OPERATION CRUSADER game. This is basically a traditional Ugo - Igo system. On the Saipan map, each hex is 1.8 miles across and a Game Turn equals one day of actual time.<br/><br/>The Island Battle of Tarawa is a tactical-level game covering the invasion of Betio Island, part of the Tarawa atoll. This is a two map introductory level game using a game system called STS (Simple Tactical System) that Fresno Gaming Association claimed as their own. The STS is a pseudo-simultaneous-movement system. First one player moves a stack, or performs combat with a stack, and then his opponent does the same. The first player then repeats this with another stack, etc. The Game Turn continues according to the Sequence of Play until chance ends the Turn. That is determined by combat die rolls. Each hex on the Tarawa map represents 35 yards from hexside to opposite hexside and a Game Turn represents 2 hours.<br/><br/>9&quot; x 12&quot; x 2&quot; bookcase style game box; <br/>16-page (8?&quot; x 11&quot;) Rules booklet; <br/>two 22&quot; x 34&quot; unmounted game maps; <br/>17&quot; x 22&quot; unmounted game map; <br/>960 die-cut, back-printed, unpunched, cardboard counters; <br/>five card-stock Player Aids; and <br/>a 10-sided die.<br/><br/>',

        description: "On December 7th, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy bombed the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, an unprovoked attack that, brought the United States into World War 2. Instead of delivering a fatal death blow that would give the Empire of Japan dominance of the Pacific region, the attack's ultimate consequence was to, in words attributed to Admiral Yamamoto, &quot;awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.&quot;<br/><br/>In The Pacific War - From Pearl Harbor to the Philippines, two players face off in an epic struggle for control of the Pacific area of operations. In action from December 1941 to June 1944, the Japanese player uses his forces against the Allied forces from the United States, Great Britain, Australia and the Netherlands. Aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and land-based aircraft are all involved. With them, each player plans and conducts strategies out of a limited hand of resourcey cards to gain the initiative and defeat his enemy's forces and control crucial ports and bases across the Pacific. The Japanese are at their strongest at the beginning, and the Allies gain power and resources each turn. Few would debate Japan's chances of victory, but the goal of The Pacific War is to see whether the Japanese forces can achieve better military gains and delay its defeat. Or can the Allies win a quicker victory? It's up to the players to utilize their assets to turn the tide of the war!<br/><br/>Man, your battle station . . . It's time to fight The Pacific War!<br/><br/>",

        description: "In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.<br/><br/>The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.<br/><br/>Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!<br/><br/>The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.<br/><br/>Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Panzer Battles: 11th Panzer on the Chir River, is a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game by Multi-Man Publishing and covers the classic mobile defensive Chir River Battles of the German 11th Panzer Division against the culminating point spearheads of Soviet Operation Uranus. The Soviets have successfully entombed the Stalingrad Pocket and are in the process of locking down the pocket even harder.<br/><br/>In December, 1942. Strong Soviet forces, including the 1st Tank and 5th Mechanized Armies, conducted a concerted attack against German positions in an attempt to block relief efforts directed at Stalingrad from the west. In what is considered a masterpiece of mobile defensive warfare, the German 11th Panzer Division fought a lightning series of &lsquo;fire brigade&rsquo; battles to contain and beat back the efforts of the Soviets to further seal the Stalingrad Area west of the Don Bend.<br/><br/>In an interesting twist of events, the German 11th Panzer Division, recently arrived from France is preparing to take part in the northern portion of the German relief attempt on Stalingrad (Operation Winter Storm). Full strength and available, the division launches into the Soviet drive in what has become a textbook example of a mobile defense and counter-attack which is studied to this day. It originated the term 'Fire Brigade' as used on the Eastern Front in WW2.<br/><br/>Under the energetic leadership of Generalmajor Hermann Balck and his Chief of Staff Oberstleutnant von Mellinthin, the 11th Panzer was able to defeat the Soviet mechanized drive.<br/><br/>German accounts stop right there, with a German victory. However, the win (if it can be called that) was a Faustian bargain. The Soviet drive was stopped, but at the cost of the German units designated to make the Stalingrad relief effort. There would be no Northern Pincer now. The Southern Pincer soldiered on alone. And failed.<br/><br/>The game covers all this swirling mobile action in turn representing two to three days and a hex scale of 500 meters.  Units are companies to regiments. Play is highly interactive (the only way to show its mobile nature) using a chit pull system by formation. The rules are a continued adaptation of the system shown in Bastogne: Screaming Eagles Under Siege 18-27 Dec' 44, It Never Snows, and Day of Days: The Invasion of Normandy 1944.<br/><br/>Scenarios (4 scenarios total, 2 one-map scenarios):<br/><br/>    Panzer Battles Campaign, 2 maps and 7 turns.<br/>    Containment Battles, 2 maps and 6 turns.<br/>    State Farm 79, 1 map and 2 turns.<br/>    &quot;I'll be back&quot;, 1 map and 2 turns.<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2-3 days<br/>Hex: 547 yards / 500 meters<br/>Units: Company to Regiment<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page SCS version 1.8 system rulebook<br/>One 12-page Panzer Battles specific rulebook<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-10 hours<br/><br/>",

        description: "&quot;Panzergruppe Guderian&quot;: The Battle of Smolensk, July 1941, is a wargame simulation of the German campaign to capture Smolensk in July, 1941.  The game is played in twelve turns, each one representing 2 days time, on a map scale of 10.5 km/hex.<br/><br/>This wargame is famous for its innovative use of &quot;untried&quot; Soviet units.  These untried Soviet counters enter play face down, their combat strength unknown to either player, until they take part in combat, at which time they are flipped to reveal their strength and defense numbers.<br/><br/>The game also models the effectiveness of German operations by allowing them a full mechanized movement phase both before and after combat, while the Soviets only move prior to combat.  In addition, if all of a German division's regiments attack or defend in the same hex, their strength is doubled by a divisional integrity bonus.<br/><br/>The German player scores victory points for the capture of cities, and for any Soviet units redirected from the Southwestern Front.  The Soviet player scores vp for recaptured cities and destroying entire German divisions (which possess several steps of strength).<br/><br/>The game includes: 1 map, counters (AH edition = 260; SPI edition = 200), 1 6-sided die, 1 Soviet reference card, 1 German reference card, 1 rules book, and 1 advanced rules insert.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Panzers Last Stand is a Battalion Combat Series game depicting the Axis relief operations of Budapest from January to March 1945 in what became Germany's last major offensives in the war. The campaign game covers the Konrad Operations (I, II, and III) in January 1945. There are scenarios for each of the Konrad Operations as well as Operation Southwind in February and Operation Spring Awakening in March 1945.<br/><br/>In the final months of the war, Germany was still full of fight and believed Budapest to be the key to turning the tide. With Budapest fully surrounded by Soviet and former-Axis Romanian forces, the situation in the city was desperate. The Germans devised a plan to relieve Budapest by bringing in the SS-Totenkopf and SS-Wiking Panzer Divisions from Poland to launch a surprise attack before the Soviets closed the ring on the trapped forces in the city. Launched in the wee hours on New Year's Day, 1945, the fate of the Axis hung in the balance. The Soviets, having campaigned continuously from the summer of 1944, fought back viciously and showed their mettle against the elite SS Panzer Divisions.<br/><br/>A great proportion of the armored forces for both sides funneled into the Budapest area. All but one of the seven SS Panzer Divisions and half of the Heer Panzer Divisions on the Eastern Front (a full third of all Panzer Divisions total) ultimately fought here. The Soviets committed three Tank, five Mechanized, and one Cavalry Corps to blunt the Axis drive. The battlefield became a graveyard of tanks.<br/><br/>The game showcases late-war equipment like the Tiger II, Brummbär, IS-2, and ISU-152 while also including unique units like Cavalry, Assault Pioneers, Soviet Naval Infantry, Hungarian SS, and ad hoc forces mobilized to defend Budapest. Rules covering Danube River crossing, Urban combat, redeployment deception (Maskirovka), and Festung rules highlight this unique and often misunderstood campaign.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>            The Taking of Budapest 123: Full Campaign (4 maps, 26 turns)<br/>            Operation Konrad I &amp; II (2 maps without Budapest, 10 turns)<br/>            Operation Konrad I (2 maps without Budapest, 5 turns)<br/>            Operation Konrad II (1 map without Budapest, 5 turns)<br/>            Battle for Zamoly (Part of 1 map, 5 turns)<br/>            Operation Konrad III (2 maps, 10 turns)<br/>            Battle for Komárom (Part of 2 maps, 17 turns)<br/>            Days of Battle: Opening Blows to Komárom (Part of 2 maps, 4 turns)<br/>            Operation Southwind (Part of 2 maps, 8 turns)<br/>            Operation Spring Awakening (2 maps, 10 turns)<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Components:<br/><br/>            BCS rulebook (v2.0, in full color)<br/>            Two BCS Charts and Tables (v2.0, in full color)<br/>            BCS Support rulebook (v2.0, in full color)<br/>            PLS Game Specific rulebook<br/>            Axis Player Booklet<br/>            Soviet Player Booklet<br/>            Turn Record Track Card<br/>            Axis Player Display Card<br/>            Soviet Player Display Card<br/>            Last Blitzkrieg Addenda sheet<br/>            Four 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; Full Color Game Maps<br/>            1,680 Counters (four sheets of units and two BCS marker sheets)<br/>            10 scenarios total, 2 one-map scenarios, 4 are 5 turns or less<br/>            Box and Dice<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This civil war opposes, in a first conflict phase, protestants- otherwise known as Huguenots- to catholics, then royalists to League members after the accession of Henri IV to the throne in 1589.<br/><br/>The art of war during this period of the Renaissance is rapidly changing. The great feudal landlords, steeped in morals, fight alongside mercenaries motivated by sole cupidity. The diversity of the weapons that are used offers great tactical possibilities, based on impact and fire. Gendarmes, cuirassiers, reiters, harquebusiers, lansquenets and Swiss mercenaries confront each other in a merciless fight.<br/><br/>This is a classic game system ; &laquo; I go, You go &raquo;, of average complexity, including, during the active player's phase, a sequence of reaction from the passive player, such as fire, counter-charge or tactical backstep. The maps are whith areas from 300 to 500 m by side. A color code allows to easily determine the costs of movements and the line of sight. The scale of the game is one unit for 100 to 500 soldiers or one or two guns. One game turn represents a duration of 20 to 30 minutes. A corps represents either a vanguard or a rearguard, or the main body called battle.<br/><br/>The combats allow to simulate charges &laquo; in wall &raquo;, the merciless shocks between pikemen, the artillery fire and highlight, by a support system, the combination of iron -shock- and fire -shooting. The optional rules- caracoles, orders, lost children, looting- add even more realism to the era's battles. The rules and the five battles offered are based on a thorough bibliography and researches made into books written by (non???) contemporary authors, specifically Fran&ccedil;ois de la Noue for the Protestants and Blaise de Montluc for the Catholics, and also on precise topographical plans of each battlefield that is still accessible, except for Saint-Denis... Are you ready to put on the Prince of Cond&eacute;'s, the admiral of Coligny's, the constable of Montmorency's, Anne de Joyeuse's or Henri of Navarre's armours and to fight your enemies &laquo; By Shot, Shock and Faith &raquo; ?

        description: "(from GMT Games' website:)<br/><br/>They called it the Great War. In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.<br/><br/>Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     316 full-color die-cut counters:<br/>         176 5/8&rdquo; die cut counters<br/>         140 1/2&rdquo; die cut counters<br/>    <br/>     One 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East<br/>     110 Strategy Cards<br/>     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)<br/>     Two Player Reference Cards <br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ted Raicer<br/>DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.<br/><br/>While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.<br/><br/>",

        description: '(from Decision games website:)<br/><br/>Pavia was the climactic clash of the Italian Wars, a decades-long struggle between Valois France and Habsburg Spain for control of Italy. Both sides have nascent pike-and-shot armies, the French still relying upon feudal knights, and the Spanish increasingly dependent on new individual firearms. Both sides also relied on mercenaries: Italian musketeers, Swiss pikemen, German Landsknechts. Tercios, too, are in their infancy; at Pavia, the battle is fought by smaller formations maneuvering in a broken, wooded area.<br/><br/>Pavia uses the new Pike &amp; Shot game system to portray the battlefields of the early gunpowder period. Infantry is based on pike formations with varying numbers of attached musketeers. Other musketeers operate independently, useful for skirmishing but vulnerable to both infantry and cavalry. Shock power comes from heavy cavalry, armored horsemen armed with pistol and sword, but relying increasingly on firepower to wear down opponents. Light cavalry roam the battlefield, too weak to stand up to their heavy cousins, but ruthless during a pursuit. The newest form of horsemen are the dragoons, men trained to fight mounted and on foot, ideal for seizing key points in advance of the main body. Artillery is still in its infancy; the large, powerful guns are all-but-immobile. However, different armies at different times experiment with lighter, more mobile weapons.<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/>&bull;    17 x 22&rdquo; map<br/>&bull;    100 die-cut counters<br/>&bull;    One Standard Rules booklet for this series<br/>&bull;    One Exclusive Rules booklet for this title<br/><br/>',

The building&rsquo;s name was drawn from Yakov Pavlov, a sergeant who led the initial storm group assault that resulted in the capture of the building from the Germans.

The emphasis is on strategic operations, from raising armies to colonizing outlying areas, to fighting barbarian incursions, to maintaining political stability at home. <br/>PAX uses a unique marker-oriented play sequence that provides surprise and opportunity, plus a deck of unusual cards that provide the historical background of events and calamities within which the players must operate.<br/><br/>PAX provides wide variety of scenarios, from fast-playing, one-sitting two-player games to vivid recreations of the entire era with four players. The game works well with 2, 3 or 4 players, and is designed to be playable solitaire for those interested in the historical view it provides. Scenarios range from The Punic Wars, through the Eastern Med conflicts between the Greeks and the Seleucids, all the way up to the entire 10 turn game, covering 300 years of history. In addition, there are two versions of PAX: the Standard Game, designed for fast play, and the Advanced version, which adds in much tangential history and allows for a more introspective examination of the era.<br/><br/>PAX ROMANA includes one gamemap, 55 cards, 400+ counters, and a host of play aids and charts to keep things organized.<br/><br/>',

        description: 'A Union invasion of northern Arkansas ground to a halt in early 1862 due to logistical difficulties. The alarmed Confederates sent Earl Van Dorn to coordinate the fractious Southern forces to repel the Yankee invaders. Van Dorn, aggressive but careless, launched a quick offensive that nearly trapped Sam Curtis&rsquo; Union Army of the Southwest, until Curtis extricated his army and placed it in a well-entrenched position on the plateau of Pea Ridge. After their rapid march north, the Confederates were exhausted and out of supplies, but Van Dorn nevertheless set them on a grueling night march around Curtis&rsquo; position.<br/><br/>Pea Ridge uses the Musket &amp; Saber system to accurately portray warfare during the American Civil War. All the primary facets of the muzzle-loading era are included. The combat system rewards intuitive play without the need for rifle-counting. There are substantial differences between infantry, artillery, and cavalry: Infantry, tough and resilient, bear the brunt of battle. Artillery can smash attacks or open holes in enemy lines, but is vulnerable and brittle. Cavalry is weak in stand-up combat, but crucial for pursuit and reconnaissance. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders provide an important supplement to unit capabilities, and armies must protect their headquarters and logistical tail or risk deterioration of their mobility and combat power.<br/><br/>Winning the battle depends upon deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.<br/><br/>',

        description: 'Battles of the American Revolution Series:<br/><br/>The Siege of Pensacola pits a numerically large but fragile Spanish army, supported by a small corps of French allies against a smaller, feistier British army enjoying strong fortifications and highly mobile Indian allies. As the Spanish player you will need to determine where you will build your siege gun redoubts and will then have to protect your soldiers from raiding British units to finish the works in time to mount an effective bombardment. As the British player, you have far fewer forces, but armed with special raiding rules, your Regulars, Tories and Indian allies must harass and erode Spanish morale, while delaying the construction of Spanish siege works for as long as possible in the hope of keeping your three forts intact to face the coming coup de main.<br/><br/>The game begins with Don Bernardo de Galvez&rsquo;s army of 5,000 having just landed on the mainland. How many forces actually are present is decided in a special phase during the initial set-up wherein that portion of the Spanish army that sailed from Havana must run the gauntlet of the Red Cliffs Fort guns. Hence, the starting forces for Spain are likely to be different for each game played as units and leaders are eliminated or delayed in their arrival. Once these forces are ashore, the Spanish player faces some hard choices. Does he send forces to take out the Red Cliffs Fort, to protect his turn 7 Spanish and French reinforcements from having to run the same gauntlet, or does the Spanish player immediately begin construction of the siege works, to achieve the longest possible bombardment before the coup de main?<br/><br/>The British player is outnumbered, but must employ his small forces in aggressive and often risky raids to slow down siege construction, wear down Spanish morale and worry the Spanish lines of supply. Getting a small force into one of two Spanish stockades can be devastating for the Spanish. Thus, though numerically superior, the Spanish player has much to do and protect, and will often be spread thin by a well-conceived series of raids. Giving the Spanish too many siege turns to bombard your three forts and/or permitting the Spanish to launch the coup de main with high army morale is likely to spell disaster for the British player.<br/><br/>',

The game recreates the events of October 7-9th, 1862, both what actually happened and what might have been...<br/><br/>In the fall of 1862, the young Rebel nation launched two invasions into border state territory. One ended in the bloody Battle of Antietam. The other&mdash;lesser known&mdash;effort culminated in the Battle of Perryville. Bragg&rsquo;s campaign to seize Kentucky from the North was of critical importance. A crippling blow dealt here would have transferred the war from Tennessee (and further south) to the Ohio River. U.S. Grant&rsquo;s efforts at Fort Donelson and Shiloh would have been voided. The war in the west would be fundamentally altered in the South&rsquo;s favor. As it was, Bragg was unable to bring in the available Confederate forces and fight a decisive battle against Buell. In this game, however, the player can take an active hand in drawing on all the Southern forces to bring on the battle that might have been.<br/><br/>With one map and 280 counters, Perryville makes an excellent starter game for players new to the successful Civil War, Brigade game series.

        description: "Sellasia, 221 BC<br/>Mantinea, 207 BC<br/><br/>Phalanx covers two of the major battles in the waning days of the Successor Wars, in which the Greek city-states and leagues and the descendants of the original Diadochoi were still fighting for Hellenic supremacy, and in which the phalanx -- the massive, heavy infantry formation brought to peak efficiency by Alexander -- was still in its heyday. The armies in these battles are very Macedonian in style, with a lot of mixing of unit types and capabilities, with the exception that, because of the terrain, reliance on cavalry is almost non-existent. The phalanx itself was still the army's anchor, although it was only a generation away from its initial comeuppance at the hands of a Roman army at Cynoscephalae.<br/><br/>To play Phalanx, you need a copy of The Great Battles of Alexander / Great Battles of Alexander, Deluxe Edition.<br/><br/>(from GMT website)<br/><br/>",

Using an original card-driven system, it provides strong historical flavor in a simple game that can consistently be played in three hours. This makes The Price of Freedom an ideal game for today's gamer's busy lifestyle, as well as for tournaments.<br/><br/>As you might expect from a quick-playing game, counter density in The Price of Freedom is purposefully low and is also constrained by each side&rsquo;s War Effort level, an aggregate measure of economic, political and diplomatic support for the war. Each military game piece represents a &quot;corps&quot; of 20-30,000 men. Corps must organized into armies led by the colorful commanders that every American Civil War aficionado has come to love or hate. Twenty-five historical army commanders are available for theater or field command, from Ben &quot;Spoons&quot; Butler to &quot;Massa&quot; Robert E. Lee, with each commander rated -1, 0 or +1 for offense, defense and movement.  Armies move and fight on a functional and yet very attractive point-to-point representation of the Eastern and Western theaters, vying to capture or defend critical territory or simply to beat each other out.<br/><br/>The card-driven engine ensures that no game of The Price of Freedom is ever the same as another and that there are plenty of hard choices to make in each campaign impulse. The game uses a well-balanced deck of 55 cards that are all playable by both sides. Each card has two uses that are generally mutually exclusive: either it can be used by spending its operational value (ranging 1-3) on various actions (moving, reorganizing or reinforcing armies) or it can be used to implement the event described on the card. Events can affect army leadership (Commander-in-Chief, Clash of Egos, Shot from the Saddle) or battle resolution (Blundering Fool; Seeing the Elephant; Bickering Generals; etc.), help gain operational advantage (Strategic Transfer; Turning Movement; Interior Lines), or simulate major political, economic or diplomatic events (Draft; Kentucky; Blockade; etc.). Like overall army size, hand size is dictated by each side's War Effort level.<br/><br/>The Union player can win by driving down the Confederate War Effort level low enough or by vastly outnumbering Confederate troops. The Confederate player can win in similar fashion or by hanging long and well enough to cause Lincoln to lose the 1864 elections or prevent the Union player from achieving the historical outcome.<br/><br/>So convene your cabinet, call up your generals, muster your troops, it is time to fight and find out what is the true Price of Freedom!<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from Compass Games website:)Components:<br/>    1 25&quot;x19&quot; cardstock map<br/>    132 counters<br/>    1 deck of 55 playing cards<br/>    2 player-aid cards<br/>    1 rules booklet<br/>    2 6-sided dice<br/>    1 full color box and lid<br/><br/>",

The game also expands on the PG visual feast of Prussian, Austrian, French, Empire, Saxon, and Russian icon units with the Hanoverian-Allied army, featuring new heavy dragoon cavalry, and a striking red-dominant color scheme.

        description: "In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.<br/><br/>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br/><br/>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.<br/><br/>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.<br/><br/>In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico, not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.<br/><br/>",

On your turn, you have the opportunity to both play and prepare a card. You can also spend cards to draft more troops, or use cards to attrition your opponents. However, your deck represents your overall resources, so moving too quickly through your deck early might result in your unsupported armies being swept away in the final rounds of the game. This is worth it if you can capture Berlin or Paris in 1915, but if your gambit fails, you may have a tough road ahead.<br/><br/>The game ends after 17 rounds of play, or earlier if one side has a commanding lead.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>',

On one side are the Athenians and the Delian League, the Demos team; against them, the Oligarchs of Sparta and Corinth are teamed.<br/><br/>The Peloponnesian War is a great setting for a historical game, having two evenly matched factions with very differing capabilities. Athens (and the Delian League, including Corcyra) commanded the seas, and relied on trade to feed their masses. On land, the Spartan phalanx was virtually unbeatable, as all adult Spartan male citizens were professional soldiers<br/><br/>Players of Quartermaster General will find most of the concepts familiar. Since the game has a smaller maximum player count, the amount of activity during a turn has been slightly increased.For example, after the Play step there is a Planning step, when you can place a Prepare card on the table. Prepare cards in Victory or Death work a lot like Response Cards in Quartermaster General, but have a much broader scope of application. Many Prepare cards are used during the Strategy step, which is at the beginning of a player's turn. Much of the game play is structured around putting together effective combinations of played cards and prepared cards.<br/><br/>",

Formula 90 is a car-racing game simulating all the typical elements of a motor sport event: car strategies, weather changes, pit stops, tire management, overtaking, doubling, and of course damages and crashes.<br/><br/>In Race! every game turn represents one or more laps of the track, and each player is in control of only one car. Other cars, called robots, move automatically on the track fighting between them and the human players. Players are provided with a set of racing cards and a car chart to keep track of all available resources (tires, damages, reliability). By playing racing cards, they move along the track and in so doing they spend resources. Movement can be affected by trajectories on the track, straight, corner and braking sections, opponents and other special events like yellow or blue flags.<br/><br/>Braking sections have a particular feature: here players and robots can try late braking, a dangerous maneuver that allows them to overtake multiple cars simultaneously. Other maneuvers or cards require a &quot;check&quot;, e.g., playing a card with a check value lower than a predefined target.<br/><br/>Strategies and driving skills are another key element of the game. Players must exploit these unique capabilities to gain against competitors while adapting their driving style to the actual race conditions. When using a strategy at his best, a player achieves a &quot;special&quot;, which allows him to draw a track card, which is usually more powerful than ordinary racing cards.<br/><br/>Race! is a board game with no dice in which strategy and risk melt together to convey a truly intense and deep racing experience. Usually the winning player combines excellent management of his car together with a pinch of opportunism and bravery.<br/><br/>',

Units moving using the actual historical map features.<br/><br/>In February 1864, US Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick conceived a bold stroke against the Confederate capital, which local Union sympathizers had correctly reported as wide open to attack. The goals of the raid were to release the thousands of Union prisoners of war held in Libby Prison and on Belle Isle, as well as inflicting damage on key Rebel installations like the Tredegar Iron Works. Secret orders also authorized the killing of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and burning the city to the ground.<br/><br/>Historically, at the last minute, Kilpatrick lost his nerve and withdrew without firing a shot. The game begins at that point, but with the assumption the Union commander's nerve holds. As the Union raiders enter the city, it's a race against time as they seek to commandeer transport for the sick, wreak destruction across Richmond as slaves and panicked civilians fill the streets, and escape before Confederate army reinforcements begin pouring in from all directions.<br/><br/>",

RAN covers several of the less famous of the Sengoku Jidai, the Age of Warring States (more or less), in which powerful Daimyo - Japanese feudal lords - strove to both maintain and extend their power bases while seeking to attain the office of Shogun, the power behind the throne of the Emperor.<br/><br/>RAN simulates the highly personal form of warfare developed by the Japanese samurai, wherein formal battles played out almost as backdrops to individual feats of courage, bravery and devotion much of it outstanding, some of it rather foolhardy, all of it very Homeric. Although political and tactical victory was the bottom line, collecting the severed heads of enemy samurai reigned a very close second in importance. In terms of tactics, this was, as in Europe, the Dawn of Modern Warfare, with the introduction of guns - arquebuses - by the Portuguese. Even with the revelatory effect of musketry, Japanese battles were still pretty much a swirling, non-linear affair.<br/><br/>RAN, the name the famous Japanese film director, Kurosawa, chose for his samurai version of King Lear, roughly means &ldquo;Chaos.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Battles of RAN (all battles are one-half map, except for Tennoji):<br/><br/><br/>    MIMASETOGE (6 October 1569): The Takeda are trying to return to their castle base, and the Hojo are trying to intercept and ambush them with twice their number.

        description: "Raphia<br/><br/>The Battle of Raphia, also known as the Battle of Gaza, was a battle fought on 22 June 217 BC near modern Rafah between the forces of Ptolemy IV Philopator, king of Egypt and Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid kingdom during the Syrian Wars. It was one of the largest battles of the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Diadochi and was waged to determine the sovereignty of Coele Syria.<br/><br/>Raphia was technically designed as a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game.  However, only a small subset of the SCS rules are needed for play. If you are familiar with usual wargame movement (what an MP is, how units count movement, etc), stacking, step loss, and retreat conventions, there is no need to review the SCS rulebook itself (not included, but will be referenced in the links section).<br/><br/>Players take turns moving their units and conducting ranged combat and melee until the victory conditions are reached.<br/><br/>A player wins Raphia by being the first to move one of their Phalanx units into the enemy home tent.  If all Phalanxes are destroyed before either player wins, the result is a draw.<br/><br/>Raphia is one of the games included in Multi-Man Publishing's (MMP) Special Ops magazine Issue #1 (Summer 2011).<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 11 x 17&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheets (140 1/2&quot; counters though only 130 are used for the game)<br/>One 4-page rule booklet<br/><br/>",

        description: "Volume III contains 7 Battles:<br/><br/>The New York Campaign :<br/><br/><br/>     Brooklyn (27 Aug 1776). Howe moves his forces onto Long Island and uses a long flanking march to get behind the advance American forces, but does not follow up his victory with an assault on the American main line. Fearing a naval trap, Washington retreats his forces to Manhattan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Harlem Heights (16 Sep 1776). After positioning new lines at the neck of Manhattan, the British move onto Manhattan and take New York City. On 16 September, an American foraging party runs into a British scouting force and a skirmish begins. Both sides begin sending forces into the developing battle. The Americans push the British back two miles nearly reaching the British camps before being stopped. The American morale, flagging after the defeat and retreat from Brooklyn, was restored. Still, the growing British threat to outflank the Americans forced Washington to fall back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     White Plains (28 Oct 1776) Historically, the battle ended after a lengthy skirmish on Chatterton Hill between a mixed force of British and Hessians versus American militia and regulars. The slow moving British prepared for a battle three days later, but by then Washington had retreated further north to cross the Hudson River and head south to New Jersey. Howe decided not to pursue and instead seized Ft. Washington. However, there are accounts that suggest that Howe might have assaulted the main American line immediately.<br/><br/><br/>The New Jersey Campaign :<br/><br/><br/>     Trenton (26 Dec 1776) Washington conceives of a bold move to cross the Delaware River and surprise the Hessian outpost in Trenton as a means to gain a victory, and turn the morale of his troops. After crossing the Delaware and marching for several hours in snow and sleet, the force divided into two columns in an effort to surround Trenton, and cut off retreat and reinforcement. The Hessians had no expectation of a surprise attack, and partied late into Christmas night. The American columns managed to emerge almost simultaneously on the few pickets, overwhelming them, and moving in and around Trenton as the Hessians scrambled to defend themselves. In less than two hours, almost the entire 1,400 man garrison was bagged.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Princeton (3 Jan 1777) At the end of 1776, Washington was facing the imminent departure of most of his remaining force. He makes a plea for men to stay on for six more weeks for an additional bounty and was able to pull together 5,000 troops. With these, he crossed the Delaware River into New Jersey again. Sidestepping the British forces marching to Trenton along the main road, the Americans make a back road march towards Princeton. Sending a force to guard a bridge over the main road to slow a British response, this force runs into a trailing British regiment. A battle ensues in a nearby field. The fast marching Americans defeat the British forces, capture supplies at Nassau Court House, and march on to Morristown to winter quarters, but loss General Mercer.<br/><br/><br/>Two Bonus Scenarios!<br/><br/><br/>     Stony Point (16 Jul 1779) Wayne's surprise attack on the Hudson River fort. The Americans went in with only bayonets and cutting equipment. They managed to capture nearly 500 of the 600 man garrison.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     King's Mountain (7 Oct 1780) The rebel militia avenge their defeat at Camden with a decisive defeat of the Tories, ending Cornwallis' attempt to conquer the Southern colonies until the following year..<br/><br/><br/>Components: Two 22 x 34 inch maps, 560 counters, rules book, storage bags and dice.<br/><br/>The easy game system recreates battlefield conditions with a move-fight-rally play sequence to simulate the grand tactics of these battles.

        description: 'By the winter of 1942, the Red Army of Workers and Peasants had contained the German attacks of the previous summer and fall. Now came the time for a whole series of counter-offensive of its own, designed to cut off and destroy the weakened Nazi armies.<br/><br/>The northernmost of these would be Operation &quot;Mars&quot;, aimed at the German Ninth Army around the city of Rzhev, west of Moscow in the winter of 1942. The Soviet plan, the work of the brilliant Marshal Georgi Zhukov, called for smashing the already-weakened Germans with a heavy commitment of tanks and fresh troops. When this first objective had been reached, a second operation, code-named Jupiter, would encircle and destroy the German 3rd Panzer Army to the south.<br/><br/>Despite horrible weather and very rough forested terrain, the initial Soviet attacks went very well. But German resistance stiffened, and as the Red Army failed to make further progress Zhukov reacted by committing more and more men and tanks. Suicidal courage only added to the Soviet casualty lists, and by the time the offensive sputtered to a halt Soviet losses topped 335,000 men and 1,600 tanks.<br/>Little known thanks to Soviet government silence for 50 years, the offensive was designed as a companion to the &quot;Saturn&quot; offensive around Stalingrad. The fact that the offensive was repulsed with heavy losses meant it was not discussed in Soviet accounts of the Great Patriotic War. While the offensive failed to accomplish what the Soviet High Command and General Georgi Zhukov wished, it did provide what the Soviets needed most, a means of keeping German forces of Army Group Center in place while the Saturn offensive in the south ran its course.<br/><br/>Red God of War covers Operation Mars using the same game system as Alsace 1945 and America Triumphant. Game pieces represent regiments, brigades and divisions. Headquarters are vital to activate units and send them into action; supply is also important to keeping your units at full efficiency and players must choose how to allocate their resources.

One player plays the Germans and their allies (the Axis) and the other plays the Soviets. While paper and cardboard cannot possibly simulate a large-scale war, this game does attempt to model some of the significant aspects of the conflict, and also give the players an idea of the problems their historical counterparts faced.<br/><br/>Masahiro Yamazaki has long been considered the East Front specialist in Japan. His games - including the excellent Stalingrad Pocket by the Gamers - have been enjoyed by English gamers since 1992. Now, for the first time, MMP is very proud to present his ultimate vision of the War in Russia. With over 10 years of development and expertise, Masahiro has culled all of his talents to give you the finest game on the entire Eastern Front of World War Two.<br/><br/>Red Star Rising is part of the International Games Series (IGS) from Multi-Man Publishing (MMP). Using a variant of the popular Victory in the West chit pull system, but with some very novel twists, Masahiro presents the theater as never before.

        description: '(from Compass Games website):<br/><br/>Red Storm Over the Reich is a Ted Raicer game covering the epic final campaigns of WWII on the Eastern Front, as the forces of the Soviet Union smashed the German armies defending Poland, East Prussia, and Pomerania, and advanced across the Oder to Berlin. Included in the game are three scenarios.<br/><br/>The first scenario is historical, which finds the German forces out of position. Their armies will likely be shattered on the first turn, but the victory conditions are tough on the Soviets&ndash; they must do at least as well as historically.<br/><br/>Scenario two has the historic forces, but allows the Germans to implement Operation Sleigh-ride, a sane pull-back of the main defense line along the Vistula out of range of the opening Russian barrage (an operation historically nixed by Hitler) that at least allows for a more orderly flight.<br/><br/>Scenario three combines Sleigh-ride with reinforcements from other fronts. It assumes that Hitler has had an incapacitating stroke in late November or early December, and the new Nazi leadership is sufficiently uncertain of its position that it defers in military matters to Guderian. The Ardennes Offensive is cancelled, as are the attempts to relieve Budapest, as well as substantial forces are evacuated from the Courland pocket. This increases German strength on the main eastern front by approximately 50% and doubles German tank strength, which, when combined with Sleigh-ride gives the Germans some serious fighting strength.<br/> Scenarios one and two can be completed in 8-12 hours and scenario three in 12-16 hours, depending on your individual playing style.<br/><br/>Red Storm is the opposite of 1941 East Front Games: The Soviets have assembled a massive force and will rip gaping holes in the German lines through blitzkrieg-style attacks. The German player must somehow piece together a desperate defense only to have it repeatedly blown apart by the enemy. But time is the enemy of both players in this game. The Soviets need to accomplish their victory by the end of the last turn, satisfying the historical timeline, or they lose the game, and the Germans must delay the Soviet assault on Berlin long enough to prevent the Soviet win.<br/><br/>The rules for Red Storm Over the Reich are moderate in complexity but feature enough chrome for both sides to recreate this desperate campaign. Special rules include: the creation of Kampfgruppe divisions (or not), naval evacuations, panzerfausts, Volksturm divisions, Leaders, Soviet Logistical Constraint, Hitler mandated attacks and more!<br/><br/>Included with each game are two maps each 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo;, two sheets of counters (456 total), rules, set-up charts, tables, dice and game box.<br/><br/>',

Red Typhoon simulates the early 1942 Russian counter-offensive in front of Moscow that almost destroyed Army Group Center. Can you as the Soviet player complete the destruction or can you as the German player survive the Soviet onslaught.<br/><br/>Red Typhoon is a two player game following an IGO-UGO turn sequence with activation points controlling the movement and attack of each of your formations. This means that some units will not move or attack, some will just move or just attack and some will both move and attack. The players choices of how to use his activations is the most important decision in the game. Combat is fairly traditional with the additions that units are retreated by the attacking player and that retreated units are disrupted. Players able to take advantage of these two factors will be successful.<br/><br/>The game starts with several large Soviet breakthroughs that the German player must skillfully plug and in certain situations counterattack. There are special rules for German panzers, Soviet Airborne and Partisans.<br/><br/>First published as Panzer Korps 04: Red Typhoon in Command Magazine (Japan) #85 (Mar-Apr 2009)<br/><br/>',

Axis units mostly represent army corps. These include German, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Romanian units; the latter two will eventually switch sides. The Axis player actually starts the game with more tank units, the real striking power in this game, than the Soviets. But as they&rsquo;re lost they are difficult to replace, while Soviet power just keeps surging.<br/><br/>Like Defiant Russia, Red Vengeance isn't a very large game. The 17x22-inch map fits easily on a small table. There are 140 playing pieces, and it comes in a small box that's easy to store.

        description: "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Reds! is a two-player wargame covering these dramatic events from August 1918 to the start of 1921, when the last organized opposition to Red rule outside the far east was destroyed.<br/><br/>The single large-hex map stretches from Warsaw in the west to Omsk in the east and from Murmansk in the north to Tashkent in the south. Across this vast expanse, players maneuver a colorful array of combat units representing various White factions, Anarchists, Nationalists, Alied Intervention Forces, the two divisions of the Czech Legion, and six Polish armies.<br/><br/>Units range from armies to brigades. The Red Order of Battle is built around 16 Red Armies organized by Leon Trotsky. There are also two powerful Red cavalry armies and the elite Latvian Rifle division. The White Order of Battle includes everything from Cossack cavalry corps to Muslim partisans and a German Free Corps. Each side also has support units: naval and river flotillas, air units, and, of course, the famous armored trains. Key leaders are also included: Frunze, Denikin, Wrangel, and Trotsky and his famous Red Train.<br/><br/>To model the chaos of this many-sided multi-front war, the sequence of play is based upon random chit pull which determines the order of activation of each White faction or six Red Army Front commands. The key Logistics phase, in which disrupted units are rallied and unsupplied units attritted, is also randomly determined. The game also includes TWO random event tables: one for each side.<br/>From sweeping cavalry advances to slogging matches over major cities (such as Tsaritsyn - the future Stalingrad - know as the Red Verdun), Reds! is a true player's game.

The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!<br/><br/>Players make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to govern provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents. A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin's blade.<br/><br/>",

Each game and module in the series will add maps, units, and all the personalities that will enable you to play, in some, but not daunting, detail your favorite periods.<br/><br/>Volume I, Rise of the Roman Republic, is the introductory game to the Ancient World series with shorter, smaller scenarios. Rise of the Roman Republic includes scenarios for the Samnite Wars (which also includes a three-player version that takes in the invasion of Alexander of Epirus), the invasion of Pyrrhus (including his Sicilian adventures), and also the first three years of Hannibal, all on a single map of Italy, complete with dated road system.<br/><br/>The focal point of the game system is the unusual set of mechanics that, in essence, have no allowance limits to movement. Units - troops under a leader - are free to move as far and as long as they want, subject to two major factors: leader capability to do so, as well as attrition.<br/><br/>The Romans are really fun, mostly because you have to master the Roman political system, from yearly elections, to pro-roguing consuls, even to asking the Senate permission to do many things, all of which serve to make running the Roman armies about as close to realistic as has ever been seen in a wargame.<br/><br/>The land combat system uses a unique Combat Results Table that includes the dreaded Unusual Result dicerolls, which replicate the battles that took place wherein the outcome belied the odds. But you still get the Carthaginian cavalry, the Epirote hoplites, elephants, and all the usual goodies you'd expect in such a game.<br/>The Ancient World is aimed at aficionados of the subject, as well as those interested in the breadth and depth of campaign operations.

        description: 'Risorgimento 1859, the Second Italian War of Independence, covers the second such war, the first, in 1848, having resulted in heavy defeats at the hands of the Austrian/Hapsburg armies. But the 1859 war was different. The Piedmontese, the Italian province pressing the issue, had gotten Napoleon III and the French Army to help them. Garibaldi and his partisans were most effective in creating havoc. And the Austrians were woefully weak in high command ability and unit morale.<br/><br/>Risorgimento 1859 is a big game, yet easy to play. The battle games are very enjoyable with lots of maneuver and combat. The Campaign game uses a point-to-point map system. The focus is on coordination and concentration, the ability to guard avenues of approach, and the capability of units to engage in combat.<br/>Battles and Campaigns<br/><br/>Players fight the two major battles of the campaign, Magenta and Solferino (one of the largest battles in European history). The rules are relatively short and very accessible, as the battle system is designed for ease of play. For example, combat units do not have any numerical Strength! However, they do differ in Morale.<br/><br/>Magenta<br/>A wild battle fought in the vineyards, where no one could see anything. Reinforcements coming from all corners of the map, as the French have to cross a major river to take the important rail center.<br/><br/>Solferino<br/>The Austrians and the French literally stumble into each other in teh difficult and hilly country south of the Lombardian lakes. The battle that followed, pitting 4 French corps against 7 Austrian corps, was one of the most brutal in modern history. So brutal that it led directly to the founding of the Red Cross. The French, having started first, get to attack an Austrian-held position that takes advantage of every hill and valley.<br/><br/>The Campaign<br/>Play out the entire Campaign and see if you can avoid the mistakes the Austrians made.

        description: "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>During the summer of 1941, the forces of German Army Group North appeared to be advancing irresistibly toward Leningrad, the second largest city in the Soviet Union, and the birthplace of the Communist revolution. But Leningrad was a long way from the German border, and the closer the Germans got to it, the more difficulties they encountered with terrain, their own lengthening supply lines, and stiffening Soviet resistance.<br/><br/>In mid-July, approximately 100 miles south of Leningrad at Soltsy, a surprisingly strong Soviet force of about six divisions struck the German armored spearhead and pushed it back. The 8th Panzer Division did not suffer the catastrophic losses claimed by the Soviet, but attack did cause the Germans in this sector to halt for three crucial weeks before resuming their drive on Leningrad.<br/><br/>In August the Soviets launched another counteroffensive, this time with ten divisions, against the German flank south of Staraya Russia. Just as the German offensive against Leningrad renewed, the Germans diverted critical motorized reserves to deal with the threat, winning a strategically barren victory far from their true objective. When the Germans did reach Leningrad, they lacked the strength to break into the city itself.<br/><br/>The battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russia may well have saved Leningrad.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&middot; 22 x 34 inch map sheet (19mm hexes - double sided)<br/>&middot; 3 sheets of 5/8&quot; counters<br/>&middot; Rules book, Play Book, set-up cards, and player aid cards<br/><br/>TIME SCALE  12 hours per turn  <br/>MAP SCALE  1.2 miles per hex   <br/>UNIT SCALE  Battalions and Companies<br/><br/>DESIGNERS Vance von Borries<br/>DEVELOPER Tony Curtis<br/>MAP &amp; COUNTER ART Mark Simonitch<br/><br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)Roads to Leningrad is a package consisting of two separate operational level games on WW II --the Battle of Soltsy and the Battle of Staraya Russa.<br/><br/>Scenarios: <br/>1. The Battle of Soltsy: Manstein&rsquo;s LVI (Panzer) Corps was assigned the road through Soltsy and was told to advance rapidly east to Novgorod and then north to cut Leningrad off from the rest of Russia. Manstein was on such a quick and tight schedule, he had no time to cover his flanks - a fact local Soviet commanders quickly exploited.<br/><br/>2. Counter-Blow at Soltsy: Led by the powerful and highly decorated 70th Rifle Division, the Soviets quickly surrounded German armor at Soltsy, stopped German motorized infantry in the swamps to the north, and raided German supply columns to the German rear. Von Manstein, unflappable in a crisis, organized a counterattack to allow the 8th Panzer to escape. The German 8th Panzer Division permanently lost about 30 tanks (with many others damaged) and retreated 25 miles. It was a Soviet victory that might have saved Leningrad.<br/><br/>3. Battle of Staraya Russa: In early August, the Soviet High Command prepared a surprise counter-offensive south of Lake Ilmen to relieve pressure on the increasingly hard-pressed armies defending Leningrad. Within two days, Soviet mechanized units had penetrated 35 miles and threatened to surround German X Corps. The Germans will clearly need reinforcements; can they hold on until Manstein's motorized troops arrive?<br/><br/>4. Manstein Attacks: To solve the deepening crisis at Staraya Russa, the German command called on Manstein's LVI Corps. On the 19th he struck, crushing the Soviet flank division in one day. In three days, he surrounded Soviet 34th Army, forced most of it to surrender, and then pushed on east. German play in this scenario depends on the mobility and timing of Manstein's troops. The Soviet player knows he is about to be trapped but maybe one more push would break the German infantry to the north.<br/><br/>",

        description: 'Roads to Moscow: Battles of Mozhaysk and Mtsensk, 1941 is a two-player game depicting battles in the Soviet Union during the drive on Moscow in October 1941. The two separate battles shown in this game are named for the main objective city on each map, Mozhaysk to the west of Moscow, and Mtsensk to the south. Perhaps the most dramatic of the many desperate battles fought in front of Moscow, these two battles combined all the elements of the great struggle. The Germans have an excellent fighting machine but are short on fuel and time. They must capture their objectives on a tight schedule or snow and mud will end their offensive. The Soviets are down to the rearward remnants of their once immense armies. If the Soviets can avoid being encircled by the fast moving German forces, high quality reinforcements from the Far East may finally allow them to stop the German advance.<br/><br/>Historically, the Soviets stood fast at Mozhaysk, fighting heavily even on the old Napoleonic battlefield of Borodino. Like Napoleon, the Germans eventually took the field, but at great cost in time and manpower. Near Mtsensk Guderian&rsquo;s Panzer spearhead advancing north from Orel was ambushed by the Soviets thereby disrupting the German timetable. This gave the Soviet 6th Guards Rifle Division time to dig-in on the heights above Mtsensk thereby barring the way to Tula and Moscow.<br/> Roads to Moscow uses the same mechanics found in the acclaimed Roads to Leningrad game, featuring a chit draw for activation of formations. Both players quickly learn how to use their motorized units effectively for overruns, combined arms, and movement of reserves.

But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins.

Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.<br/><br/>In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!<br/><br/>Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.<br/><br/>The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.<br/><br/>UPC 742818050029<br/><br/>",

The Germans believed they could launch an offensive on both sides of Reims, which would pinch out an Allied salient and draw in Allied reserves, and thus possibly produce a breakout across the Marne leading to the final drive to Paris. Despite gaining their bridgehead across the Marne, the Germans did not expect the fierce resistance offered by the Allies including the American 3rd infantry division-which earned its honorific name &ldquo;Rock of the Marne&rdquo; for its steadfast defense.<br/><br/>An even bigger surprise awaited the Germans, however, when the Allies attacked them with crushing power from a wholly unforeseen direction three days later. Refusing at first to relinquish the initiative, the Germans showed why they were masters of defensive warfare in World War 1 as they exacted a fearsome toll in casualties from the attackers including the American 1st and 2nd infantry divisions.<br/><br/>Rock of the Marne shares many of its design features with MMP&rsquo;s earlier game on the 1918 battles - Operation Michael. The Germans&rsquo; striking power consists of the battle-depleted, but still dangerous, stosstruppen. Trained specifically in infiltration tactics, these hard-core infantry units can find a way to pick apart the toughest Allied defensive position. The Germans also have mobile, and deadly, machine-gun units that will wreak havoc on unwary attacking Allied units. The Allies used tanks in record numbers in their initial assault, and these are shown in the game, as well as the six big American divisions that participated including the famous 1st Infantry Div, The Big Red One, the 42nd Infantry Div, the Rainbow Division, as well at the 3rd.<br/><br/>The air game has been significantly expanded in Rock of Marne as both sides deploy their air assets to bomb bridges, and strafe infantry. Finally, both the Allied and the German player must learn to operate within their constraints and opportunities of the WWI command and control environment, which means you may not automatically get to attack with all the units you had planned!<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    One 22&quot;x34&quot; map<br/>    280 counters (1 countersheet)<br/>    Series Rules<br/>    Rock of the Marne Specific Rules<br/>    Two Dice<br/><br/><br/><br/>Part of the Standard Combat Series.<br/><br/>',

        description: 'Rommel at Bay is an operational level simulation of the World War II Allied offensive in southern Tunisia which took place in mid-March 1943. Located here were the main Axis fortifications defending Tunisia, fortifications nearly as formidable as those at Alamein. Had the German-Italian army succeeded in defending, the war in North Africa would have been lengthened and perhaps Allied command would have changed again. The playing pieces represent the actual units which participated in the campaign and the map represents the actual terrain over which those units fought. Rommel at Bay is basically a two player game in which one player controls the Axis forces while his opponent controls the Allied forces.<br/><br/>The two players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play. Victory occurs and the game ends immediately when one player has achieved the conditions given in the scenario being played. The other player wins the game by preventing his opponent from achieving his victory conditions.<br/><br/>The game has two scenarios. The first (Medenine) is a smaller scenario of the battle that was fought March 6th to 8th 1943. The second scenario is the main Mareth Campaign March 20th to 28th.<br/><br/>',

Experience the wargame many consider the best on the subject.<br/><br/>Rommel in the Desert simulates the experience of command. The real problems of generals have nothing to do with shuffling combat factors to get a perfect 3-1 attack while the enemy waits passively to be overwhelmed. Rommel gained many of his victories by employing speed, daring, and surprise.<br/><br/>In this game, as in the desert campaign, the events of the battlefield are often subordinate to the battle of wits and nerves between opposing commanders. A good grasp of strategy will help, but foresight, nerve, and instinct are the crucial elements of success.<br/><br/>CONTENTS<br/><br/>    100 wooden blocks (20mm)<br/>    Labels<br/>    Mapboard (11 x 34 inches)<br/>    Rules 1.02<br/>    42 Supply Cards<br/>    4 Dice<br/><br/><br/>(adapted from Columbia Games website)<br/><br/><br/>Rommel in the Desert is a pre-&quot;Front&quot; game touching on the conflict between the British and Germans in North Africa during WWII. A game of maneuver, each side has to move with precision and know when to strike, since a cut in supply spells disaster for either side. The supply system is card driven. The game comes with a map of North Africa and 100 wooden blocks to represent the British and Germans.<br/><br/>This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and its current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.<br/><br/>(from BGG user)<br/><br/>',

        description: "Root is a game of adventure and war in which 2 to 4 (1 to 6 with the 'Riverfolk' expansion) players battle for control of a vast wilderness.<br/><br/>The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance&rsquo;s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.<br/><br/>Root represents the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.<br/><br/>The Cats play a game of engine building and logistics while attempting to police the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to produce workshops, lumber mills, and barracks. They win by building new buildings and crafts.<br/><br/>The Eyrie musters their hawks to take back the Woods. They must capture as much territory as possible and build roosts before they collapse back into squabbling.<br/><br/>The Alliance hides in the shadows, recruiting forces and hatching conspiracies. They begin slowly and build towards a dramatic late-game presence--but only if they can manage to keep the other players in check.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict for their own gain, while hiding a mysterious quest. Explore the board, fight other factions, and work towards achieving your hidden goal.<br/><br/>In Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability.

        description: "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>&quot;At the start of 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt had divergent views on the conduct of the war. The British Prime Minister favoured a strategy which focussed on the peripheries of Europe: Italy was a ripe fruit ready to be plucked, via Sicily. For the American President on the contrary, Germany was the sole objective. The enemy was to be struck right in the heart of his war economy, the Ruhr, and by the most direct route: France ! Two operations are studied in the game : &quot;Round up&quot; and &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; which for the Anglo-American general staffs quickly became one operation, &quot;Roundhammer&quot;.<br/><br/>The Trident conference in Washington in May 1943 gave Churchill his way, clearing the road for the invasion of Italy. The Quebec conference in August 1943 (Quadrant) cancelled Roundhammer definitively in favour of the future Operation Overlord in 1944, developed in the game Liberty Roads.<br/><br/>But what would have happened if the allies had dared to launch Operation Roundhammer in mid-September 1943, as the generals had planned?<br/><br/>At this date, the Atlantic Wall defences were still barely started on many beaches. A large number of the German divisions in France at that time were undergoing training and were not yet operational. As for the Panzer Divisions, they were not yet equipped with the formidable Panther tank.<br/><br/>But on the allied side there was a lack of US units. The majority had been sent to the Mediterranean, or were training in the USA. The amphibious capacity of the invasion force was far from sufficient and British reserves were very weak. Worse yet, aerial supremacy was not complete with an omnipresent Luftwaffe. Mission impossible?<br/><br/>The Roundhammer 1943 module allows you to supply an answer through this what-if game ! The extension of Liberty Roads includes those extra units present in Western Europe at the time, along with new supports and Atlantikwall/D-Day markers, with a &lsquo;1943&rsquo; ambiance.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        description: 'The Struggle between the Russian and Ottoman Empires was already centuries old when war broke out in 1877. It had its origins in the bitter conflict between Muslims and Christians, Slavs and Turks. The war proved to be a turning point in that it completely altered the balance of power in the east. In less than 40 years this helped produce the European catastrophe known as the Great War (WW I). Echoes of these ethnic and religious troubles resound today, as the peoples of Balkans and Near East still fight each other in a struggle for dominance. The Russo-Turkish War did not just cripple the Ottoman Empire. It made Russia into the dominant power in the East, and demonstrated the twin impact of modern technology and modern ideology on warfare.<br/><br/>The System rules apply to all games in the Wars of the Imperial Age series, and simulate the conditions of warfare in the late 19th century. This is a revision of the System rules presented with Franco-Prussian War (S&amp;T #149), and completely replaces the System rules book found there. Important changes from the original version are indicated by a double pound sign (##) at the beginning of the rule. Players familiarizing themselves with the game may wish to use just the System rules. The Specific Rules that apply only to the particular game and cover military and political conditions unique to the specific situation.<br/>Units represent historical leaders and headquarters staffs; corps, division-, and brigade-sized units; and fortifications. Each unit is rated for its combat strength, training class, and movement ability. (Specific Rules) Additionally, headquarters are rated for their Operations capability to enhance movement and combat capabilities, as well as conduct various politically oriented functions.<br/><br/>All units are deployed face down, and are revealed to the enemy only if he conducts reconnaissance or intelligence operations. Movement is performed by the moving force rolling on one of four March tables (Regular March, Forced March, Railroad, Naval) and applying the result. Combat is fought between enemy units in individual adjacent hexes; each player draws a Battle Results marker at random. This gives the number of enemy combat factors eliminated, effects on enemy morale, and special results for cavalry, and siege guns.The typical size of units are brigades.<br/><br/>Politics are a factor in the game.

The game covers the desert battles around El Alamein from July 1 through July 18, 1942. The British Commonwealth 8th Army must hold the line against the battered Panzerarmee Afrika, since Alexandria and the virtually undefended Nile Delta lie less than 100 miles to the east.<br/><br/>The map depicts the battlefield of El Alamein, from the Mediterranean Sea in the north, to the virtually impassable Qattara Depression in the south.<br/><br/>The game system tries out some unusual mechanics to simulate the fast-paced flow of desert warfare. Combat units are rated for firepower and assault strength, while AFVs have an armor rating, and artillery has an anti-tank rating.  HQs are used for activation of units in their formation. Rules of interest are Opportunity Fire, Overruns, Reaction Movement and Withdrawal Fire, Airstrikes and Fortifications.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by points gained through objective hexes, enemy units eliminated, and for occupying portions of the 'coast road'... the player with the most points wins. The difference in points between the Commonwealth and Axis player determines the level of victory.<br/><br/>Originally published by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #105.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 1.5 miles<br/>Unit: Company to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 16&quot; X 21&quot; mapsheet<br/>One countersheet (100 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 12 page rules booklet<br/><br/>",

        description: "The Bohemian Revolt of 1618 triggered the Thirty Years War and in the early period of the war the Catholic/Imperial cause enjoyed an almost unbroken string of victories. This game, part of the Musket and Pike Battle Series, simulates six battles of the early Thirty Years War. In the period covered, the armies deployed in more compact formations so each battle fits on half of a standard map.<br/><br/>The battles covered in this game are:<br/><br/>White Mountain<br/>November, 1620<br/>The combined army of the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic League under Johann Tserclaes, the Count of Tilly, strike a blow directly at the Bohemian capital of Prague. The Bohemians make a stand on the slopes of White Mountain outside the town. Their Transylvanian allies desert them at the most critical point of the battle, causing the total collapse of the Bohemian army and its cause.<br/><br/>This is a short scenario where the qualitatively superior Catholic forces must crush the strongly positioned Bohemians who are bolstered by a large Transylvanian contingent of questionable reliability.<br/><br/>Wimpfen<br/>May, 1622<br/>Tilly joins forces with the Spanish under Cordoba. Together they pursue the smaller army of the Markgraf of Baden-Durlach. They catch his army near the town of Wimpfen, where it is drawn up in a defensive position in a river bend. The Badian camp is fortified in a special traditional way with Spie&szlig;wagen (&quot;pikewagons&quot;), mobile barricades equipped with sharp poles and small mortars. Only when a powder wagon detonates in the midst of the Protestant position, scattering the defenders, the Catholics are able to storm the wagonburg and heavy fighting breaks out.<br/><br/>A balanced pitched battle. A larger Catholic army tries to defeat a Protestant army that is not only protected by a wagonburg but also possesses a strong cavalry force for counterattacks.<br/><br/>H&ouml;chst<br/>June, 1622<br/>The Bavarians under Tilly catch the forces of the zealous Protestant Duke Christian as they try to cross the river Main. To protect the crossing, Christian makes a stand at a stream. At first Tilly hesitates, but eventually the Bavarians attack and the Protestant army dissolves in a chaotic retreat.<br/><br/>A rearguard situation, where the Protestants must delay the Catholics while simultaneously trying to retreat the majority of their army to safety.<br/><br/>Fleurus<br/>August, 1622<br/>Defeated and demoralized, the combined forces of the condottiere Mansfeld and Duke Christian try to escape the German theater and enter the service of the United Provinces instead. Cordoba's Spanish army blocks them at Fleurus in what is today Belgium. The unpaid and mutinous Protestants attack at dawn in an attempt to break through. In a vicious five-hour fight, the Spanish hold, but enough Protestants break through to force the Spanish to lift an important siege in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>This is a smaller pitched battle where a large but very unreliable Protestant army attempts to overwhelm the smaller but more experienced Spanish army. This battle is suitable as an introduction to the game system.<br/><br/>Stadtlohn<br/>August, 1623<br/>Following the battle of Fleurus, Duke Christian again rebuilds an army with raw recruits to join with Mansfeld in the Netherlands and renew the fight for the Protestant cause. However, he soon finds himself outlawed by the Imperor, unsupported and forced to retreat when Tilly's veteran army bears down on him. The Protestan army, slowed by a massive baggage train attempts a last stand and finds itself caught by Tilly's vanguard when within sight of the Dutch border. True to form, Christian decides to risk his army to save his baggage train, but ends up losing both.<br/><br/>A race-against-the-clock rearguard situation where the focus is on the fate of the Protestant baggage train that is slowly moving towards the map edge.<br/><br/>Lutter am Barenberge<br/>August, 1626<br/>The Danish King Christian IV intervenes in the Thirty Years War and pushes Tilly back during the early summer. However, he finds himself outnumbered and on the defensive when Tilly is reinforced by Imperial troops. Christian decides to turn on his pursuers and gives battle in a strong defensive position at Lutter am Barenberge. The initial Catholic attacks are repulsed, but the subsequent uncontrolled Danish counterattack results in the eventual collapse of the Danish army.<br/><br/>This is also a rearguard battle, but with more evenly matched armies, though the Danes are severely hampered by an unusual command situation.<br/><br/>In addition to scenario specific special rules that highlight the unique events of each battle, the battles in the game all share a simple set of special rules. These rules show the peculiarities of the early years of the Thirty Years War, such as Croat/Transylvanian style light cavalry.<br/><br/>Even though not all of the battles included were equal contests in military terms, the player victory conditions are balanced. Along with the special rules, that means the battles are interesting for both sides.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Add-on module for War Galley.<br/><br/>Salamis, one of the most famous naval battles in history, was a direct result of the Persian need to keep their large, invading army supplied by controlling the sea lanes. With Xerxes' army temporarily delayed at Thermopylae, the Greek fleet, based at Artemisium, some 50 miles or so directly east of Thermopylae, took the opportunity to attempt to stop the Persians from extending this Line of Communications. In a battle that appears to have extended over two or three days, the Greeks managed to eke out a slim tactical win. However, when Thermopylae fell, Themistocles' position became untenable, and the Greek fleet retreated to anchorage in the narrow channel of the Bay of Eleusis, west of Athens, at Salamis.<br/><br/>With her naval flanks secured, the Persians rolled into lower Greece, capturing Athens and razing the town. However, to complete his subjugation of Greece, Xerxes had to destroy their fleet. To that end, the Persians sailed to a position south of Salamis.<br/><br/>At Artemisium the Greeks had learned that, while their crews and marines were superior, the huge disparity in numbers could be telling. Unless they could neutralize this Persian strength.<br/><br/>To that end, Themistocles lured the huge Persian fleet to attack the Greeks in the Bay of Eleusis, whose entrances were so restrictive as to negate any numerical superiority.<br/><br/>There were two entrances to the bay. To plug up the western escape hatch, Xerxes dispatched his crack Egyptian squadron. Upon hearing this, Adeimantus and his Corinthians peeled off from the main fleet and sailed to the western mouth to block any Egyptian attempt to gain entrance. This &quot;action&quot; appears to have been a stand off, with both sides &quot;blockading&quot; and not fighting.<br/><br/>At the eastern entrance, the Greeks deployed in three lines, along a narrow front of about 1800 yards, thus negating Persian numerical superiority. The Persians entered the bay in three long lines astern, which they then turned into nine lines abreast.<br/><br/>The result was a boarding battle, and this was where the Greeks shone. Despite having half the manpower per ship of the Persians, their weaponry, armor and land-based tactics were superior to that of the Persians. And that superiority resulted in a smashing Greek victory.<br/><br/>Xerxes retired to Thessaly, to try again the next year. The result was a great Greek victory, on land, at Plataea, followed by the Greek victory that completely cut Persian Lines of Communication, at Mycale.<br/><br/>(from GMT website)<br/><br/>",

Samurai covers all the major battles of the Sengoku Jidai (the Age of Warring Daimyos). Japan was truly a country at war. Because of the nature of 16th century Japanese warfare, it is also the easiest game in the series to play. The revamped command system simulates the clan-oriented levels of leadership, plus simplified shock and fire mechanics. Also included are individual samurai used to challenge opponents and collect the important severed heads. Ignore the challenge and lose face, or even be forced to commit seppuku on the spot.<br/><br/>Battles include the most unusual Okehazama, complete with burning castles, thunderstorms, and a historically victorious army out-numbered six to one; Anegawa; Kawanakajima; Mikata-ga-Hara; Nagashino, with the famous Takeda cavalry corps charging Oda's volley-firing musketeers; and the most famous battle to take place in Japan, Sekigahara.

        description: "In all the spectacle of war there has seldom been a sight the equal of British General Burgoyne's campaign of 1777. The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.<br/><br/>The intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.<br/><br/>The fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, &quot;Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die.&quot;<br/><br/>It's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?<br/><br/>As the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?<br/><br/>These are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.<br/><br/>",

Unlike previous games in the series, initial turns are strategic, reflecting troop movements over 1 and 2-day periods and allowing for the buidling of defenses by both sides.  When the American/French player decides to assault the city, the game switches to the familiar tactical game turns reflecting a single hour of battle.<br/><br/>Random Events is one of ten new features and a deck of 55 Random Event cards is provided, most of which define historical events from the actual siege and assault. Players have a maximum of nine opportunities to draw from the deck, although players may use Momentum Chits to &quot;purchase&quot; extra card pulls. Some cards benefit only the Allied Player(s), others benefit only the British Player and some can benefit either player.

As chief of the pre-war German general staff, von Schlieffen envisions a powerful group of German armies (the Right Wing) quickly moving through Belgium and northern France to attack Paris from the rear, while weaker forces protect the German border with France.<br/><br/>France mobilizes according to their own 'Plan 17'.  This offensive-minded plan calls for the bulk of French forces to quickly re-conquer those parts of France lost to Germany in 1870.  To do this, France masses her armies along the German border between Belgium and Switzerland.<br/><br/>As the Schlieffen plan is executed, tiny Belgium is invaded by 4 separate German armies.  The Germans believe that the Belgians will either offer no resistance, or will quickly be swept aside by their might.  But Belgium does resist, fighting on in the face of hopeless odds, even as the Germans employ secret weapons like the massive Big Bertha guns.<br/><br/>As events quickly unfold, Great Britain lands an expeditionary force in France to help defend Belgium and assist France.  It meets the German juggernaught as it pushes through Belgium.<br/><br/>The French, meanwhile, incur huge losses when they execute 'Plan 17'.  They now rush to stop the Germans from reaching Paris.<br/><br/>The plans of both sides fail, due to not only to mistakes in execution, but due to causes that could have been foreseen and acted upon.  As a result, neither side is able to achieve its objectives, and the consequences is the stalemate of trench warfare.<br/><br/>The Schlieffen Plan covers the campaign in Belgium and France from August to November 1914.  In this simulation, you assume the role of the commander of either the German or Allied armies.  The forces available to you are the same that were available to the historical participants.  Bit it is up to you to make your own strategic decisions, and to execute your your own plans as you see fit.  This is your chance to prove that you could have done better, that you could have changed the course of history.<br/><br/>This is the first in a series of simulations designed to interlock to allow you to simulate conflicts and campaigns from 1914 to the present and beyond across all of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.  Each simulation is self contained.  Yet, tied together, they will allow you to control all aspects of land, sea, &amp; air warfare.<br/><br/>Scale is 20km/hex<br/>4 days per turn<br/>Unit Sizes: Division/Brigade<br/>560 Backprinted Counters<br/><br/>Medium Complexity<br/>Very High Solitaire Suitability<br/><br/>",

        description: 'In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.  This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.<br/><br/>Skip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow &amp; Righter and manufactured by Cadaco. Both games have identical rules but Skip-a-cross has tiles and racks made of cardboard instead of wood.

The 101st has battled their way to the small Dutch village of Veghel.  All they need do now is await the arrival of XXX Corps on their way to Nijmegen and beyond to Arnhem. As fate would have it, the Germans planned otherwise. German armor and infantry conducted several determined attacks on the positions held by the 101st.<br/><br/>Operation Market-Garden is usually best remembered for the stubborn defence of the Arnhem Bridge by the British 1st Airborne. The equally important role of the two American Airborne Divisions is often neglected. Screaming Eagles in Holland covers the crucial defence of the Veghel bridges by the 101st Airborne.

That war was fought primarily between two coalitions of European powers, but it also involved fighting in the Americas, India and the East Indies, as well as on the high seas. It was also a time of expansion for the Manchu Empire, which could have put China on a collision course with the Europeans. Historically, the Seven Years War resulted in the domination of central Europe by Prussia and of North America and India by Great Britain.<br/><br/>Seven Years World War can be played by two, three, or four, each representing a different coalition of powers. Each player has a variety of military, diplomatic and economic instruments with which he can attempt to dominate the world.<br/><br/>The Major Powers includes: Austrian Empire, France, Great Britain, Maratha Confederation (India), Manchu Empire (China), Ottoman Empire, Prussia, Russian Empire, Spanish Empire, and United Provinces (Netherlands).<br/><br/>The game map shows the world as it was during the mid-18th century. A square grid has been superimposed on the map to regularize the position and movement of the playing pieces.  Players should note the actual geographic boundaries of the various empires and powers are slightly distorted to clarify their position on the map.<br/><br/>The game is won by gaining control of strategic objectives that can then be translated into success at the peace table.<br/><br/>',

This new edition is quite different from Dean Essig\'s original game from back in 2000. It features a revised order of battle, modified rules, and a new map. The most obvious change is in scale: hexes are now 3.5 miles across and there are two turns per week (the original had 2.5-mile hexes and four turns per week). This makes for a smaller, faster game that conforms to the scale chosen for Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe and the upcoming games set in Western Europe. We think Sicily II is a perfect way to give new recruits their baptism in the fire of OCS, and is also a worthy entry in the series for players who have already earned their stripes.<br/><br/>Here are some of the game&rsquo;s highlights:<br/><br/><br/>     The entire campaign lasts just 16 turns.<br/>     There are six scenarios in all (three using the entire map, and three using just a portion).<br/>     The Allied airborne fiasco is recreated with simple scatter rules. <br/>     The amphibious landings can be played out using standard OCS naval rules, or players can mostly skip these and begin with the bulk of Allied forces already ashore.<br/>     The Luftwaffe&rsquo;s Do.217K makes its series debut, armed with exotic Fritz-X missiles.<br/>     Rules for Italian unit wavering and surrender make every game different.<br/>     Several interesting options are provided, including revised Axis deployment and variable entry of the 29th Panzergrenadier Division.<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 3 to 4 days<br/>Hex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km<br/>Units: Company to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>    Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 16-page Sicily II rules booklet<br/><br/><br/>Players will have to use OCS v4.2 rulebook/charts &amp; tables for another OCS game or download them from <a target=\'_blank\' href="http://www.gamersarchive.net/theGamers/archive/ocs.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">http://www.gamersarchive.net/theGamers/archive/ocs.htm</a><br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-20 Hours<br/><br/>',

Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. First one Player moves his units and conducts attacks, and then the other. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. This gives Players a chance to &quot;change history.&quot; No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>',

        description: "One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games, highly prized by collectors.<br/><br/>This one is the American War of Independence game. The British have four armies of 5 units each, 3 warships and a troop carrier with 2 reinforcements on board. The Americans have 16 units spread all over the board (including a special &quot;Continental Army&quot; unit), 1 warship and a troop carrier with 4 reinforcements on board.<br/><br/>The Americans use two dice for movement (unless down to just one unit), the British one. All three dice are 0-1-1-1-2-3. Both players roll their dice using shakers and peek at them. The British player designates the unit he'll move, then the American reveals his throw and moves. Finally, the Bristish reveals his throw and moves.<br/><br/>A single unit is moved by each die --the grid is square and no diagonals are allowed. Units that end up on the same spot stack to form an army (which cannot be split), but each army is limited to 6 units. Naval moves are harbour to harbour except for the troop carriers (and any warship attempting to intercept them).<br/><br/>A Skirmish occurs when opposing units are adjacent. A card is drawn to resolve the Skirmish. This can result in a unit loss for either side (sometimes two), a major battle being triggered, or one or both armies moving a space or two. Major battles normally occur when an army lands on an enemy army by exact count; numerical superiority is added to the stronger side's throw, and the adjusted throw difference indicates how many units the losing side lost (however, that loss is limited to the number of units in the winning army).<br/><br/>Once the British have lost an army, they can call for Reinforcements. The Americans can do this once they've won a Major Battle. Reinforcement play is resolved separately from normal play. Two dice are used by both sides, one player trying to bring in his troop carrier whilst the other attempts to intercept with a warship (if the opponent has no warships left, the reinforcements automatically succeed). If the troop carrier makes it to a harbor, the reinforcements land (triggering a major battle if the harbor is enemy-held) and the troop carrier remains as a normal warship henceforth.<br/><br/>The British win by eliminating the Continental Army, whilst the American wins by eliminating all four British armies. To keep the game from dragging on, if there is no skirmish nor major battle in 10 moves, the weaker side surrenders.<br/><br/>The asymmetrical mechanics work surprisingly well; the British lacks mobility and try to force Major Battles on the Americans, whilst the latter skirmish as much as possible until they can muster a large enough army together to win a major battle and call in their reinforcements.<br/><br/>",

Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!<br/><br/>On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go &quot;into decline&quot;. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.<br/><br/>Clarifications: available in a pinned forum post.<br/><br/>',

        description: "Between 1767 and 1846, war and intrigue dominated the Indian sub-continent. War constantly flared between the Indian kingdoms, both against one another and against the British and French interlopers. The Europeans, meanwhile, also busily fought each other.<br/><br/>Rob Markham's Soldier Raj builds on the highly successful model of Soldier Emperor to portray these conflicts. Over a dozen scenarios cover these wars, from Hyder Ali's defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain's final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the &quot;sepoy general&quot; who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France's Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. These and more lead your armies.<br/><br/>The playing pieces are the decadently thick tiles seen in Soldier Emperor and Granada: The Fall of Moslem Spain. Artist Terry Moore Strickland has gone well beyond those games; pieces like the Mysore Tiger Soldier or the Maratha War Elephant are tiny works of art.<br/><br/>As in Soldier Emperor, successful card play is a key to victory. Soldier Raj features high-quality playing cards, and includes a new deck of these for use in Soldier Emperor when playing the two games together.<br/><br/>Soldier Raj can also be played together with Soldier Emperor. Players can either add more seats at the table, or assign the Indian kingdoms to players with only European holdings. Britain becomes both more powerful in the combined game, and more vulnerable.<br/><br/>As in Soldier Emperor, players command their nation's military, political and economic destiny. The map is a painting of South Asia, with a network of areas and routes between them laid over it. Generals move their armies along these routes, attempting to conquer territory for their nation. Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice. Good generalship is even more crucial in India than in Europe. Players win by taking the most territory, or by destroying their nation's enemies.<br/><br/>",

These ships act as action spaces that players use to gather resources, explore the nearby planets, and build their stations. Turns are fast and straightforward; either take ship action or take income.<br/><br/>Many games start players off with a small resource engine which they build up to a bigger one. In Space Station Phoenix, players start with the best production engine they will ever have and proceed to break it down part by part. As the game progresses, their actions get more efficient, but the number of ways to take those actions starts to diminish.<br/><br/>Space Station Phoenix also features deep re-playability with millions of possible starting positions and station parts combinations.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>',

        description: "From the Publisher's website:<br/><br/>&quot;Spartacus&quot; is a two player, card-driven, point-to-point wargame simulation pitting a loose coalition of forces under Sertorius against the Roman Republic as restructured under Sulla and his lieutenants.<br/><br/>As the Sertorian coalition, your objective is to force the Republic into collapse in order to rebuild it as it was before the Sullans changed the constitution. This is done through putting pressure on the Republic by territorial conquests, by exacerbating the tensions in the Republic, forcing it to utilize the services of new, potential Sullas to counter your armies in the field, or by taking Rome itself!<br/><br/>As the Republic, you must defeat and neutralize Sertorius quickly, before he can conclude an alliance with Mithradates VI and cause a two-front war. However, the levying of too many troops to fight the enemy coupled with the utilization of ambitious generals can bring on the very circumstances you are trying to avoid, collapse of the Republic. In addition, care must be taken with Italy itself because in the background, civil war looms in the guise of Lepidus, and even worse, a slave revolt under the able gladiator-leader, Spartacus.<br/><br/>Both sides can battle their adversaries using conventional forces, conduct guerrilla and pacification operations with the intention of denying your opponent control of strategic spaces and provinces, and attempt to hasten or delay the political collapse of the Republic. The central mechanism that influences all actions in the simulation is the Republican Crisis Track, which monitors the level of crisis in the Republic. All actions on the battlefield, the state of the empire, the strain of recruiting legions and utilizing ambitious generals, and the use of power politics, are ultimately reflected on the Crisis Track. The Sertorians hope to move the track towards heightened crisis while the Republic hopes to keep it well away from a political collapse. In the end, if the Republic manages to avoid collapse, it can still lose by having a strong, Sertorian presence on the board.<br/><br/>Spartacus requires the player to successfully exercise many facets of military-political acumen in order to defeat his opponent while preserving the most precious asset of all, survival.<br/><br/>",

Each curve on the track has a speed limit that cannot be exceeded without penalty. If you exceed curve speed, overaccelerate or overdecelerate your car, etc., you pay penalties in tire wear or possible damage to your car or elimination from the race.<br/><br/>The original 3M Sports Games version used speedometer wheels to select speed, used a random card draw to determine the car characteristics and has no random elements.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Speed Circuit: British Grand Prix<br/>    Speed Circuit: Detroit Grand Prix<br/>    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de Belgique<br/>    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de France<br/>    Speed Circuit: South African Grand Prix<br/>    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 1<br/>    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 2<br/>    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 3<br/>    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 4<br/>    Speed Circuit: Tournament Tracks<br/>    Speed Circuit: Turnier Kurs<br/><br/><br/>',

        description: "Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players, offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!<br/><br/>Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.<br/><br/>In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.<br/><br/>As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.<br/><br/>With these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.<br/><br/>",

        publisher: 'The Avalon Hill Game Co',
        description: "Starship Troopers is based upon the popular novel of the same name written by the dean of science fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:<br/><br/>&quot;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.&quot;<br/><br/>Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:<br/><br/>&quot;A suit isn't a spacesuit &mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.&quot;<br/><br/>With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as<br/><br/>&quot; . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.&quot;<br/><br/>In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.<br/><br/>But the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:<br/><br/>&quot;The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...&quot;<br/><br/>As the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.<br/><br/>The game is set up in a &quot;Programmed Instruction&quot; system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. &quot;Flores died on the way up&quot;) to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.<br/><br/>Warfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race. It was a very near thing.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 5<br/><br/>",

        description: "Publishers blurb: &quot;STORM OF STEEL is a complete simulation of World War One. The three maps cover Europe from the Pyrenees to the Urals, plus the Middle East. Fighting rages from St. Petersburg to Verdun to Baghdad and beyond. The maps can be combined for one grand game of the Great War, or they may be used separately for theater-level campaigns of the eastern front, the western front and the Middle East. The game rules use a modular approach, which allows players to employ the level of complexity they desire. Turns are quarterly, but players can use special campaign cards to provide additional move-fight impulses, recreating the intensive offensives of the war. There are scenarios for each year and each front of the war, as well as a grand game for the entire war. There is also a &quot;what if&quot; scenario for the war continuing into 1919.<br/><br/>Units represent land, naval and air forces. Ground forces are portrayed at corps level. Each corps is rated for the number of divisions it includes; so players can concentrate for the offensive or disperse for the defense. Corps include infantry, shock troops, mountain infantry and cavalry. There are also specialized armored car and tank brigades, as well as tank corps for 1919, plus the planned-for American airborne division. Each country has its own unique order of battle so, for example, the Austro-Hungarians have mountain corps, and there are also additional units representing Bolshevik and independent nationalist forces.<br/><br/>Naval units are at the squadron level for capital ships, and flotillas for cruisers and destroyers. There is also a complete submarine warfare module for attacks on merchant shipping. Air warfare is represented by strategic and tactical wings. A unique feature of the game is players can improve their aerial warfare capabilities by increasing their air doctrine level. As air doctrine improves, players can employ interception, aerial supply and aircraft carrier operations. On the subversive side, players can utilize agents to conduct propaganda and sabotage operations to undermine their foes from within.<br/><br/>Land combat uses three different combat results tables to model different tactics. Tank and shock troop units can use the much more effective Infiltration CRT. Naval combat requires opposing fleets to first acquire each other, then engage in gunnery. Lighter fleet units become invaluable for recon and screening, while battleships and battlecruiser squadrons close in for the kill. In the air, players can execute a variety of missions, including air superiority and bombardment.<br/><br/>An industrial production module gives players the capability to produce different types of forces. Production is tied to morale, and winning great battles will enhance your side's output while a disastrous defeat may lead to strikes on the home front. Storm of Steel uses a card system to generate major operations. Campaign cards give players additional move-fight impulses, combat bonuses and extra reinforcements. Players have to carefully choose which campaigns they will implement because some cards, such as the Schlieffen Plan, will provide for more maneuver, while others, such as Verdun, will enhance combat. There are also cards that will grant tactical innovations such as chemical warfare and armored doctrine, as well as bringing into play leaders such as Hindenburg, Brusilov and Lawrence of Arabia.&quot;<br/><br/>",

One player controls the German army, and the other player controls the Soviet army.

The game is 6 turns long, at the end of which time the winner is determined by comparing the players predetermined controlled victory areas to actual.<br/><br/>The prize at the end of Germany's 1942 summer offensive was Stalingrad. The city, while being a propaganda key due to its name, was also a key industrial city sitting upon both rail and river networks. The German 6th Army hit arrived at the west bank of the Volga by late August and began their assault on the city. &quot;Stalingrad must not be taken by the enemy&quot; ordered Stalin. Now you can command the defense of the city and try to hold versus a talented, but stretched thin, German Army.

In Storm Over Stalingrad, players alternate impulses where they move or fire, but only rarely both. Cards influence play, but do not drive the game. Can you take most of the city of Stalingrad before the Soviet offensive begins?<br/><br/>This game uses a simplified version of the Storm over Arnhem system.

        description: "From the box:<br/><br/>The gameboard is your battlefield.  You have an army of men at your disposal and six bombs.  Your mission--protect your flag and capture your opponent's flag.<br/><br/>Secretly place your men, bombs, and flag on the gameboard with these objectives in mind.  But remember your opponent is doing the same thing, so you must plan a defense as well as an offense.<br/><br/>Once the armies are in place, advance your men.  When you're one space away from an enemy, attack.  You and your opponent declare ranks.  The lower-ranking man is captured and out of play.<br/><br/>You control your pieces and risk your men in battles where the strength of your enemy is unknown. The suspense builds as your men move deeper into enemy territory. Move with caution and courage. The next piece you attack could be a bomb.  And when attacked, it could &quot;blast&quot; your man off the board and out of play.<br/><br/>The first to capture an enemy flag is the winner!<br/><br/>This game is similar to, and almost certainly derived directly from, the H.P. Gibsons (UK) game L'Attaque (1909). It is not exactly the same, but not far from it (numbered pieces, spy (same name) can kill the strongest piece but only when attacking, flag, bombs, etc.) This game in turn almost certainly drew on the classic Chinese children's game Jungle.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>     Stratego (Revised Edition) (aka Stratego Fire &amp; Ice)<br/>     The Generals<br/>     Stratego Legends<br/>     Stratego: Star Wars<br/>     Stratego: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition<br/>     Ultimate Stratego<br/>     Electronic Stratego<br/>     Stratego: Marvel Heroes<br/>     Stratego: Star Wars Saga Edition<br/>     Stratego: The Chronicles of Narnia – The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe<br/><br/><br/>and numerous others.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Admirals<br/>    Lu Zhan Jun Qi<br/>    L'Attaque<br/>    Attack<br/>    Batalj<br/>    Sharpe's Attack<br/><br/><br/>Different Edition Complications<br/>When first produced in Europe, the most powerful pieces had higher numbers.  I.e. the Marshall (most powerful piece) was a 10, the General was a 9, and so on.  The higher the rank, the higher the number.<br/>When they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....<br/>Then, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.<br/>This caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)  Many of these insist on playing Stratego with the 'Marshall 1 system'.<br/>This wouldn't be a problem, except any and all discussions of Stratego are fraught with misunderstandings by those who are unaware of dual numbering systems!  Keep this in mind when reading information about Stratego.<br/><br/>",

Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire.  Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.<br/><br/>From the designer:<br/>Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution. Even though it is a big empire building game, it will scale from 3 to 7 players and has pretty simple rules.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Suleiman the Magnificent is a game covering the massive battle on August 29th, 1526 between the Ottoman Empire and the army of the Kingdom of Hungary that eventually resulted in the fall of the latter kingdom and the disappearance of Hungary as an independent country for 400 years. The Hungarians numbered around 35,000 (including artillerist), the Ottomans, about 60,000. While there is much disagreement about numbers at this battle, all sources agree that the Ottomans did outnumber the Hungarians significantly. The Hungarian front line was stretched rather thinly to match, or attempt to match, the frontage that would be presented by the Ottomans. The Hungarians had, as was the practice for the last 200 years in European warfare, dug a trench in front of their front line infantry and artillery to give them a defense advantage. The actual battle, which started at around 3:00 PM, lasted but a few hours, maybe less.<br/><br/>Each combat unit represents about 750 men. The map scale is about 225 yards per hex and depicts the flat and, because of the proximity of the oft-overflowing Danube, somewhat soft and, in many places, slippery battlefield at Mohacs.<br/><br/>Suleiman the Magnificent is an accessible, fast-playing, fun game of low complexity. Optional rules include the politically charged issue that has reverberated down over the centuries, that many of the contingents of allies called in by Hungarian King Lajos did not arrive in time for the battle. Some were never going to do so; some were held back - specifically the charge leveled at Johann Szapolyai, Voivode of Transylvania because of his ambitions for the Hungarian throne (which he did get after Lajos' death and some deals reached with Suleiman).<br/><br/>Full color 22&quot;x34&quot; map <br/>240 full color die cut counters <br/>Rulebook length - 12 pages<br/>Charts and tables - 2 pages <br/>Complexity - Low <br/>Solitaire suitability - Medium <br/>Playing time - 2 hours<br/><br/>Design - Richard Berg<br/>Development - Paul Rohrbaugh <br/>Graphic Design - Craig Grando<br/><br/>",

        description: "The Sun Never Sets is a mid-to-high complexity operational level game of the colonial wars fought by the British during the 19th century.  It includes three separate games, namely &quot;March to Peking&quot;, &quot;Zulu War&quot; and &quot;The Sudan&quot;.  The game includes a core set of rules used in all three scenarios and scenario-specific rules unique to each game.  Optional rules add further chrome and complexity to the game.<br/><br/>March to Peking depicts the Anglo-French attack on China in 1860 to force it to open itself up to European trade.  Special rules allow for the veteran Chinese Hunan army (engaged fighting the Taiping rebels elsewhere) to march to Peking's relief.<br/><br/>Zulu War depicts the British campaigns in 1879 against the Zulus in South Africa.<br/><br/>The Sudan covers three separate campaigns; the 1883-85 Mahdist uprising in Sudan, the defence of Khartoum in 1884-85, and the recapture of Sudan in 1896-98.<br/><br/>The game consists of rules, two 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps and 620 counters.<br/><br/>",

The system allows for a full grid of cars &mdash; not just the players', but also privateers that ran alongside, and usually hindered, the factory teams.<br/><br/>Each player controls two racing teams: one in the top category and another slower team unlikely to win, but capable of reaching the podium and ending in the money. That is important since the game's winner is based on money earned. Winning, though, is adjusted based on the level of cars a player selects, so taking the &quot;best&quot; cars may not be the optimal strategy for victory when the car ability bonus is applied.<br/><br/>Gameplay is handled with a randomized team draw that determines player order in addition to generating random events; these events emphasize the dangerous and unreliable nature of 1920s and 1930s driving, courses, and early race technology. On a player's turn, cars move a certain number of spaces with the option of slipstreaming, &quot;charging&quot; (which permits multiple bonus spaces if clear track is ahead), and blocking (which can force trailing cars to spin out).<br/><br/>The game takes 45-60 minutes to play a race, and games can be combined into a multi-race contest or even a full season if the players wish.<br/><br/>Supercharged reworks the 1992 game Grand Prix Manager by the same designers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The Warsaw Pact player must capture Munich and drive back the NATO forces in southern West Germany. A variety of NATO forces have gathered to stop the onrushing Soviet and Czech forces.<br/><br/>The Across the Rhine Scenario begins at a later stage in the conflict, with the assumption that the Warsaw Pact has broken through the &ldquo;forward defense&rdquo; lines of NATO.

One player, called the Patriot Player, controls the forces and destiny of the rebellious Americans; the other, the Crown Player, seeks to bring the rebels to their senses.  The exact Victory Conditions of the game may vary depending on which historical events the players choose to re-enact.<br/><br/>Many aspects of warfare have been abstracted to focus squarely on issues of supply: protecting, moving, capturing, and effectively using it to further your goals and frustrate those of your opponent.  Supplies come in two flavors, and are represented on-board by wooden cubes.  Food Supply is expended to move your units, and War Supply to fight.<br/><br/>There is no hidden information, other than what your opponent intends to do, but flexible movement rules allow for considerable bluffing and misdirection.  The game rewards boldness but also punishes the slightest error-- that is, if your opponent is clever enough to capitalize on it.<br/><br/>',

        description: "Supply Lines of the American Revolution: The Northern Theater, 1775-1777 was a surprise hit for publisher Hollandspiele and designer Tom Russell. Popular with grognards and logistics nerds alike, it secured a nomination for the 2017 Golden Geek Award for Best Wargame. This hotly anticipated standalone sequel covers the second half of the American War of Independence, and shifts the scene to the Southern colonies of Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas.<br/><br/>It's more than just a change in locale, however; this game has a very different feel and emphasis than its predecessor. Both sides have much smaller armies with far fewer resources. The South, after all, is really a very minor theater: the British are chiefly concerned with holding onto their Caribbean possessions, particularly with the French, Dutch, and Spanish circling around those profitable islands, while George Washington is obsessed with taking back New York. Unsupported, Cornwallis must attempt to pacify the southern colonies one at a time while coming to grips with the slippery colonials, while avoiding being trapped himself. Maneuver is central this time around, thanks to new and utterly unforgiving siege rules.<br/><br/>And while this operational cat-and-mouse chase dances across the colonies, partisan warfare rages as both sides seek to win hearts and minds. Crown Loyalists can greatly extend Cornwallis's supply lines, while daring Patriot Militia can harass the redcoats with Raids.<br/><br/>To win this game and the war itself, you'll need to master irregular warfare, operational maneuver, siegecraft, naval affairs, and, of course, and perhaps above all, logistics.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        description: "Sweden Fights On is a tactical battle game featuring four battles from the later half of the Thirty Years War. It is the second volume in the Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series covering warfare in the 17th Century. This volume traces the fall, revival, and pinnacle of Swedish military fortunes after the death of King Gustav II Adolf at L&uuml;tzen in 1632.<br/><br/>The Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series transitions from the English Civil War period (This Accursed Civil War, Vol. I) to the Thirty Years War period with added features such as limbered guns, double-sized batteries, and organic regimental artillery. The system emphasizes command and control.<br/><br/>Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.<br/><br/>The four battles in Sweden Fights On are:<br/><br/><br/>    N&ouml;rdlingen 1634 <br/><br/><br/>Though the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated. A strong Swedish force pushed into Bavaria under the joint command of Duke Bernhard and Field Marshal Horn. The Habsburgs effected a union of forces with their Spanish cousins at N&ouml;rdlingen, besieging the Protestant stronghold. The Swedes were drawn into a trap.<br/><br/><br/>    Wittstock 1636<br/><br/><br/>The Cannae of the Thirty Years War. Field Marshal Ban&eacute;r had his lines of communication cut by an Imperial-Saxon army under General Hatzfeld. In a daring plan, Ban&eacute;r divided his numerically inferior force and launched a double envelopment. In a desperate struggle for Vineyard Hill, General Torstensson's cavalry held the line just long enough for General King's cavalry to make the march around the Imperial right flank.<br/><br/><br/>    2nd Breitenfeld 1642 <br/><br/><br/>Field Marshal Torstensson caps a brilliant campaign with a siege of the Imperial fortress of Leipzig. Archduke Leopold commanding a larger Imperial army rushes to engage the Swedes. Within sight of the same ground of Gustav Adolf's greatest victory from eleven years past, the armies met. The Imperials had hopes for another N&ouml;rdlingen, yet they got another Breitenfeld.<br/><br/><br/>    Jankau 1645 <br/><br/><br/>Field Marshal Torstensson launches a surprise winter campaign aginst the unprepared Imperial forces in Bohemia, catching the Emporer himself virtually unguarded at Prague. With all haste, General Hatzfeld is recalled and an army cobbled together to stop the Swedes.

        description: 'The hobby of wargaming was born in the 1950s with the publication of the game Tactics. TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.<br/><br/>TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).<br/><br/>The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.<br/><br/>Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry, armor, mountain, airborne, headquarters, and amphibious troops. 100 counters in all.<br/><br/>TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Operação MX-1, was released in Brazil. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Tactics III&quot;.<br/><br/>',

        description: "&quot;Tarawa: Bloody Betio&quot; is a solitaire wargame that attempts to simulate the World War 2 battle over Tarawa Island between Japanese and US forces.  In the historical battle, the US Second Marine Division had 3 days to clear the island of Japanese soldiers.  The bloody battle inflicted nearly 3,000 casualties on the Marines; only 17 of 4,700 Japanese soldiers survived.  The solitaire game places the player in command of the US forces to determine how he performs compared to the historical outcome.<br/><br/>A map overlaid with a hexagonal grid forms the game's playing field.  In the middle lies the isle of Tarawa, surrounded by water.  The terrain and Japanese defenses are also printed out, as well as the US-designated landing beaches.  Each turn, the player receives an amount of forces to deploy onto the beaches.  He handles attacks between the two armies, rolling dice and checking tables to resolve their effects.  When the Marines has defeated the Japanese in a hex, a cleared marker is placed on it (and removed if the US forces retreat from the hex due to a counterattack).  If the Japanese attack is particularly effective, the Marines suffers casualties, which is reflected by moving a marker on the Casualty Track.  The player also has to concern him with Booby-Traps, Snipers, Air Raids, Morale, and Supply.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of the third turn.  The player wins if all hexes of the island are cleared and the Casualty Track reflects less than 5,000 casualties.<br/><br/>",

        description: "&quot;Tarleton's Quarter!&quot; is a game about the British attempt to win the American Revolution by invading the Southern colonies, The game covers the period from the British landing in Georgia in 1778 to October of 1781 (the historical end of the siege of Yorktown and the surrender of Cornwallis' army). The object of British efforts in the South was to bring the four southern colonies - Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia-back under British sway after almost four years of uninterrupted Continental control. Ideally, the English wanted to &quot;restore civil government,&quot; i.e., to return the South to its status ante-bellum with British governors, taxes paid to the Crown, and no expensive garrison to enforce the situation.<br/><br/>&quot;Tarleton's Quarter!&quot; highlights some salient aspects of the British campaign in the south. First and foremost was the effect of leadership, and the difficulty both sides had in finding leaders who were bold without being rash. Rarely did energy and sound judgment come in the same package. Another vital factor was the terrain of the southern colonies, or rather, one feature of it: water. The reason that water &mdash; in the form of rivers and swamps &mdash; is the dominant terrain feature is &mdash; surprise! &mdash; it rained a lot, particularly in the Carolinas. These facts &quot;on the ground&quot; raise the amount of non-combat losses, like those caused by disease, which made just keeping an army intact such a headache at the time. (There's nothing romantic about losing large numbers of men to something beyond a player's control.) As to why so many people lived in North and South Carolinas' pestilential swamps, it was because those swampy areas were precisely where rice and indigo grew best, and in the 18th century in the Carolinas, that was where the money was; cotton was a much later development.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most important factor of all was the continuing British belief in an untapped reservoir of loyalist support in the south. Those in command of the British army knew they didn't have enough manpower to control even the southern half of the American colonies on their own. They were relying on the appearance of a &quot;silent majority&quot; of loyal, but previously suppressed, American subjects who would take control of those provinces swept of Continental forces. Appropriately, you are allowed to indulge in as much over-confidence as your red coat will allow.<br/><br/>",

He controls more powerful wizards than does Lord Forseti, and he can gain allies in the magical fairy people known as the Cadmin and the mighty dragon, Terromax.

        description: 'In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.<br/><br/>The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.<br/><br/>Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters (which are temperature, oxygen, and ocean coverage). However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.<br/><br/>Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:<br/><br/>1) Player order shifts clockwise.<br/>2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.<br/>3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.<br/>4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.<br/><br/>When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!<br/><br/>',

The player then moves units of that sub-command and, at the completion of its movement, conducts attacks with units of that same sub-command. Play then passes to the other player, who similarly picks a marker and moves and fights. That procedure continues until all command markers have been picked. Additionally, certain events cause players to pick &quot;heroism markers&quot; at random, which may generate anything from mad, impetuous charges to abject surrenders.<br/><br/>The rules are divided into the standard rules, which are common to all games in the system, and the scenario rules, which provide deployment and reinforcement instructions, as well as victory conditions, for each specific battle game.<br/><br/>In this game, each turn represents from three days to three weeks, depending on the level of intensity of campaigning, and each hexagon on the map represents 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) across.

        description: 'The Third Winter: The Campaign for the Ukraine, September 1943 - April 1944, begins with the &ldquo;Race to the Dnepr,&rdquo; as Army Group South rushed to a secure defensive position behind one of Europe&rsquo;s largest rivers.   Four powerful Soviet Fronts must be used in close cooperation to overcome the Axis forces, which include two Panzer Armies. The game contains 85% of the total Wehrmacht&rsquo;s mechanized strength at this stage of the war and 75% of the Red Army&rsquo;s.   The Germans must hold the Dnepr barrier as long as possible, followed by a fighting retreat to the Carpathian Mountains to the west.  The Soviets can crush the Axis invader with the advantage of their most reliable ally:  General Winter.  It is the Third Winter on the Russian Front.<br/><br/>The Soviets have the initiative and a formidable force, but an equally challenging task.  The Dnepr is a huge obstacle and the German panzer formations are wounded but dangerous.  The German player has the challenge of active defense in the style of Army Group South Commander Erich von Manstein.  Both sides are in for a challenging fight.<br/><br/>The Third Winter is a big game, with 5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. The battles from this campaign &ndash; the Race to the Dnepr, the Battle of Kiev, Korsun Pocket, the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket (&ldquo;Hube&rsquo;s Pocket&rdquo;) and the splitting of Army Group South in two&mdash;merge into the dynamic of whole campaign.  <br/>Special rules in this 19th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this intense campaign. They include:<br/><br/>&bull; Soviet Front command structure is modeled by the four Fronts being either on Offensive or Paused posture.  The Soviet player can switch one front &ldquo;off&rdquo; and another &ldquo;on&rdquo; to shift focus and force the Axis to deal with sudden threats in a different part of the map.  When Soviet formations are burned out, they withdraw into the &ldquo;RVGK&rdquo; for rebuilding, and can reappear suddenly in a new area, enabling Maskirovka surprises.  Each Front has a dedicated Air Army and Frontal Barrages to initiate offensives. The game shows the increasing strength and competency of the Red Army in both units and Action ratings.<br/>&bull; German units in play include Kampfgruppe Divisions, German Remnants, German Army and Army Group HQs,Tiger Companies, Hartman and JG52 aces, Hans-Ulrich Rudel and his tank-busting aircraft, and the Romanian Home army<br/>&bull; Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning Beyond the Rhine. These cover things like Soviet Patrol Boat Raids, Lend-Lease, Fuel Shortages, Heroes who affect combat, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, and Partisan Offensives.  The 44 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.<br/>&bull; The importance and difficulty of the Dnepr crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and ferries to be emplaced, all leading to Soviet Bridgehead battles <br/>&bull; Both sides were deploying more and more anti-aircraft assets, modeled with units that make air barrages more difficult.<br/>&bull; Axis Fortress HQ units that enable cut-off units to continue to function and shows the decline of the Wehrmacht, from a mobile warfare army to a defensive army, with limited counterattack capability. KG HQs allow ad hoc mechanized formations to combine to simulate the desperate nature of the struggle.<br/><br/>The Third Winter features two monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,500 combat units. Also included are several smaller scenarios, including four 1-map games.<br/><br/>Scenario 1 The Dnepr Battles (Grand Campaign Game, 4 maps, 63 turns, 26 Sept 1943 to 26 April 1944)<br/>Scenario 2 Die G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung (January Campaign Start, 4 maps, 27 turns, 26 Jan 44 to 26 April 44)<br/>Scenario 3 Red Thunder (April Campaign Start, 2 maps, 6 turns, 8 Apr 44 to 26 April 44)<br/>Scenario 4 Manstein&rsquo;s Fire Brigades (Battle for Kiev, 1 map, 9 turns, 26 Dec 43 to 22 Jan 44)<br/>Scenario 5 II SS Pz Corps Strikes Back (Battle for Ternopol, 1 map, 6 turns, 8 Apr 44 to 26 April 44)<br/>Scenario 6 Rumanian Finish (Odessa and breaking into Rumania, 1 map, 6 turns, 8 Apr 44 to 26 April 44)<br/>Scenario 7 Hube&rsquo;s Pocket (The &ldquo;Moving Pocket&rdquo; Battle, 1 map, 8 turns, 22 Mar 44 to 15 Apr 44)<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1/2 Week<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 km<br/>Units: Company to Corps<br/> Game Inventory:<br/>Four 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheets<br/>Eight countersheets (2,240 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>One 48-page OCS rules booklet<br/>One Third Winter game rules booklet<br/>One Third Winter scenario booklet<br/>Two 4 page OCS Charts &amp; Tables folders<br/>Three Player Aid Cards (1 sided)<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>',

        description: "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Central Europe, 1618. Germany is a jigsaw puzzle of independent Electorates, Bishoprics, Dukedoms, and Imperial Free Cities nominally under the control of the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. An alliance of Protestant leaders rebel against the Emperor, who raises armies to suppress them and regain Catholic property lost during the Reformation; the surrounding kings of Spain, France, Sweden, and Denmark intervene to stake their own claims. Germany is plunged into thirty years of war that will last until 1648, when the exhausted combatants sign a peace establishing the competing spheres of interest that will control Germany for the next two centuries.<br/><br/>&quot;Thirty Years War&quot; recreates this conflict with the award winning wargame system used in GMT's Wilderness War, Paths of Glory, and For the People. There are four scenarios provided: the Full Campaign (14 turns), Early War (5 turns), Intervention (3 turns), and Apocalypse (5 turns).<br/><br/>This is a two-player wargame; one controls the Protestant forces (German Protestants, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, France) while the other runs Catholics (the Empire, Bavaria, Spain, and occasionally Saxony, which can switch sides during play!). The heart of the game is the playing card decks of 55 cards that each player receives. Playing a card gives a player the option to move and attack with an army, to recruit new units, to bank up money to pay ever-hungry troops, or to declare an event.<br/><br/>The Peace of Westphalia made certain that Germany would remain divided for another two centuries. Can the Catholic player defy history by recreating the power of the old Holy Roman Empire? Does Gustavus Adolphus survive to dictate peace to the Emperor in Vienna? Thirty Years War allows the players to determine these and other historical what-ifs, while opening a window onto one of the most influential events in European history.<br/><br/>COUNTERS: 456 full-color die-cut counters.<br/>MAP: One 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>CARDS: 110 Strategy cards<br/>OTHER: Two 10-sided dice, 32-page Rulebook, 2 Player Aid cards<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 2 years per turn<br/>MAP SCALE: Point-to-point system<br/>UNIT SCALE: 3-5,000 men each<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: One or two<br/><br/>DESIGNER: David Fox<br/>DEVELOPER: Michael Welker<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

MacGowan<br/><br/><br/>(BGG user description:)<br/><br/>A direct descendant of Paths of Glory, 30 Years War covers the confusing post-Reformation conflict in central Europe, as the Holy Roman Empire attempts to reassert domination over the protestant states. On the side of Catholicism we have the Holy Roman Empire (Austria and some of Northern Italy at this point) and Spain, opposed by a cast of thousands: the German Protestants, Sweden at the height of her power, France, England, Denmark, and others.<br/><br/>While there are some new mechanics, virtually the entire game is borrowed from elsewhere: Leader activations and movement are as in Hannibal, combat is straight out of Paths of Glory (minus the flanking), and Siege resolves much Hannibal. Your armies have to be paid, with Aid Points that are received just like Paths of Glory's RPs. An interesting twist is that the movement and support of armies results in the landscape getting Pillaged, so as the game goes on the board becomes less and less capable of supporting military operations.<br/><br/>",

        description: "This Accursed Civil War is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the First English Civil War: 1642-1646. It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.<br/><br/>The battles included in this game are:<br/><br/>Edgehill, 23 October 1642<br/>    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.<br/><br/>First Newbury, 20 September 1643<br/>    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.<br/><br/>Marston Moor, 2 July 1644<br/>    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.<br/><br/>Second Newbury, 27 October 1644<br/>    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.<br/><br/>Naseby, 14 June 1645<br/>    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.<br/><br/>2nd Printing Note: This reprint version will include an updated series rulebook and playbook and an Edgehill variant scenario, as well as numerous updates to the counters.

The command system has been changed to accommodate leader character - leaders are rated as aggressive, controlled, or timid, and are likely to gravitate to an order stance that is in keeping with their character as the battle unfolds. Correct exploitation of their capability in the battle plan is important for victory.  The melee and fire combat mechanics are also quite different from the other games in the series.<br/><br/>The counters are nicely done, icons. The maps are DTP standard.

The first drive on St. Louis had been repulsed and Van Dorn was summoned to take command of the force and launch a new offensive into the heart of Missouri. Van Dorn, an Indian-fighting cavalryman by trade, arrived at the Rebel camp and even though he was quite ill (due to a fall into a river) he immediately roused the troops. He proposed to launch an immediate attack, despite the freezing weather and fatigued state of his troops. Van Dorn force-marched the army north and managed to pull off a classic Napoleonic stratagem - the &ldquo;maneuver sur la derrieres&rdquo;. He placed his army astride the line of communications of his enemy and by any normal military measure this should have been settled the issue for the two armies. But by doing so at such an ill-advised time and at such an inhuman pace the Rebel troops were little more than a frozen and exhausted armed mob when they finally reached their positions. <br/> Brig. General Sam Curtis was not a man to be intimidated and he realized that he had a fighting chance, even in this seemingly impossible position. Perseverance and hard, smart fighting by men like Colonel Grenville Dodge and others turned what looked to be a potential disaster into a grand victory. The Battle of Pea Ridge secured for the Union all of Missouri and the northern part of Arkansas, resulting in approximately 85,000 square miles becoming Federal-controlled territory.<br/><br/>This is the second game in the Revolution Games/GMT series of American Civil War games. The first game, Stonewall&rsquo;s Sword simulates the Battle of Cedar Mountain in 1862.<br/><br/>',

Moon. &quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed &ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear &ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor.&quot;<br/><br/>Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.<br/><br/>Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a &quot;gateway game&quot; -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.<br/><br/>Part of the Ticket to Ride series.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Ticket to Ride: Europe takes you on a new train adventure across Europe. From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.<br/><br/>More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.<br/><br/>The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Copyright 2002-2014 Days of Wonder, inc.<br/><br/>Part of the Ticket to Ride series.<br/><br/>",

Ticonderoga) during the French and Indian War (1755-58). The game system emphasizes the importance of leaders, and highlights the role of individual command skills, circumstances and luck. Throughout the game, leaders&rsquo; skills are tested as their units maneuver and fight, and every leader has the capacity to be &ldquo;inept,&rdquo; &ldquo;capable&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional,&rdquo; varying from engagement to engagement.<br/><br/>The game includes a lot of randomization; so every game may vary in tempo. One game may involve more soldiers than another, and often the quality of the lower-level (unnamed) leaders will be different. There are three campaign and three raid scenarios, featuring many units for the longer games and fewer for shorter ones (280 counters total). Each hex on the Strategic Map represents 1.5 miles, whereas each hex on the Tactical Map (for the area near Ticonderoga) represents just 400 yards. Individual units represent from 50 to 800 men, and leader chits each represent a single commander, sometimes a famous historical figure, at other times an unknown man of low-rank.<br/><br/>Designed by William Nester and Eric R.

Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk &mdash; and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...<br/><br/>In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.<br/><br/>Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.<br/><br/>Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat and by gryphon to get to everywhere they need to go to satisfy their quests &mdash; or to position themselves for what night brings. As each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.<br/><br/>During the night, players must face the challenge of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on? Or is it time to save your progress and rest? Tomorrow is another day.<br/><br/>The game ends once the portal is closed or all the goblins have been eradicated. The player who has acquired the most victory points by slaying goblins, learning spells, and completing quests is crowned the winner!<br/><br/><br/>For a deluxe edition of this game, see Tiny Epic Quest: Deluxe Edition<br/><br/>",

        description: 'To Take Washington: Jubal Early&rsquo;s Summer 1864 Campaign is the third game in the Series: Line of Battle (MMP) series and covers Jubal Early&rsquo;s campaign during the summer of 1864. From June into July, Old Jube swept out of the Shenandoah Valley and across the Potomac River to advance on Washington DC. By threatening the Federal capital, Early and the Confederate command hoped to divert forces from Grant&rsquo;s Overland Campaign, relieving the pressure on Richmond.<br/><br/>Historically, Early narrowly defeated Lew Wallace on the Monocacy River, outside of Frederick, MD. However, this &lsquo;victory&rsquo; cost him precious time and manpower. Though he went on to test the outer forts protecting Washington itself (mainly at Fort Stevens), Early was too weak and too late to take advantage of the once-denuded nature of the fortress garrisons.<br/><br/>As Abraham Lincoln quipped, &ldquo;Mr. Early, you are late.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In To Take Washington, players first fight the Battle of Monocacy. Their relative success or failure there, as well as their raw efficiency, determines when the Confederates show up on the separate Fort Stevens map. An arrival mere hours earlier than their historical appearance makes an enormous difference in the strength of Union forces manning the defenses, since they had been stripped bare prior to Early&rsquo;s advance. Conversely, a mediocre showing at Monocacy will present the Confederate player with a very difficult problem at Fort Stevens. Jubal Early couldn&rsquo;t solve it &ndash; can you?<br/><br/>To Take Washington covers these two related actions on two separate map areas. One (with two map sheets) covers the Monocacy battlefield while the other (with one map sheet) shows the area around Fort Stevens and a portion of Washington itself.<br/><br/>The Series: Line of Battle (MMP) series premiered with None But Heroes, covering the Battle of Antietam, and went on to set a new standard of excellence with its presentation of Gettysburg in Last Chance for Victory: The Battle of Gettysburg. The LoB series rules are the pinnacle of over 30 years of development starting with the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series and its follow-on Series: Civil War Regimental Sub-Series (MMP). The LoB system and battle-specific rules incorporate fresh research while discarding the mistaken assumptions and false impressions that have crept into ACW games of the past forty years. Above all, Line of Battle is designed to capture the free-for-all nature of an American Civil War battle in a fun, fast, and very playable format.<br/><br/>Scenarios: To Take Washington includes twelve scenarios, with one entry point for the full two-battle Campaign Game. Ten of the scenarios use only one map (either a portion of the Monocacy map set, or the single Fort Stevens map).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 15-30 minutes<br/>Hex: 110 yards / 100 meters<br/>Units: Batteries to Regiments<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Three 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheet (840 1/2&quot; counters - 267 playing pieces, rest markers)<br/>One 36-page Line of Battle Series v2.0 rulebook<br/>One 20-page To Take Washington rulebook<br/>Two 6-page dual-side printed LoB Charts &amp; Tables v2.0 booklet<br/>One single-side printed Terrain Key<br/>One Single-side printed Turn Record Track chart<br/>Two 6-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>',

        description: "To the Green Fields Beyond is an operational simulation of the Battle of Cambrai, 1917, the first great tank battle in history.<br/><br/>David Isby : From the Designers Notes<br/>&quot;As I write this I am sitting at my typewriter in my extremely comfortable office, a mug of hot, sweet tea by my right hand, and telling you what the Battle of Cambrai was like. That is a delusion. All I can do is provide you with cardboard pieces and a paper map, and instructions on what to do with them, and maybe some words of historical commentary. Can you feel the confusion and chaos, the reports, false and true, that filled British Headquarters when the counterattack hit ? Can you think what it was like to see the ranks of feldgrau figures appear two hundred yards away, peering through the fogged eyepiece of a gas mask into the back sight of a Lee-Enfield rifle ? I cannot tell you what was in the minds and souls of men who fought the battle. I'm no artist. I design wargames&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Through the mud and the blood to the green fields beyond.&quot; This quote, attributed to Brigadier General Hugh Elles, who led the Tank Corps into action at Cambrai, succinctly states the British objective-to penetrate the German trenches and break into their rear areas. The idea of a breakthrough to the green fields beyond had dominated Allied thinking since 1915. Cambrai was to be as close as they were to come before the final breakthrough of 1918.<br/><br/>To the Green Fields Beyond is an operational level simulation of the Battle of Cambrai which lasted from 20 November to 7 December, 1917. There are two players, one commanding the British and the other the German forces. The game consists of three scenarios and a campaign game. The players should start with a scenario- the British Breakthrough is best- before attempting the full 17 turns of the campaign game. Players should note that each game turn in To the Green Fields Beyond requires many decisions, and will probably take between 30 and 75 minutes to play.<br/><br/>To the Green Fields Beyond is uncommon amongst games in that both players get the opportunity to take the offensive. The campaign game provides opportunities for both sides to attack. The British Breakthrough and Battle for Bourlon scenarios have the British attacking, while the German Counterattack scenario obviously has them as defenders, although they can still often mount attacks as well.<br/><br/>Each hex on the mapsheet represents 1250 yards from side to side.

        description: 'Toppling the Reich: The Battles for the Westwall, is an operational level simulation of the fighting for the Rhine River and Westwall that occurred in 1944 and 1945. Designer John Prados transports his Panzerkrieg game system to the Western Front to examine the major episodes of this clash. Using scenarios, which can also be linked together to form a campaign game, he covers the entire war in France and the Low Countries from early September 1944 to the German surrender in May 1945. Players on both sides will be challenged with conducting offensive operations as well as desperate defenses.<br/><br/>Units are mostly divisions with some specialist brigades/regiments (engineers, commandos, heavy or specialized armor units). Players can form larger Corps level formations that enhance combat actions. The air war is also covered with air units on both sides conducting air superiority, ground support, parachute and aerial supply missions. The game design is easy to get into, but loaded with much decision-making for both players. The level of supply and logistical support determines how many units and leaders can conduct operations in the turn. Leadership on both sides, in the form of the various Army and Front Headquarters as well as the leaders from each, play vital roles in the various operations each turn. While the Allies can field a tremendous force across the entire front, the lack of ports and the Allied ever-lengthening supply lines will be a challenge in keeping the offensive moving. The German player will have less of a challenge in providing logistical support, but his already battered Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe and SS formations will face a hard time in fending off the enemy&rsquo;s attacks while also gathering strength and resources for a counter-strike. Timing, planning, and making the most of the opportunities presented to you on the battlefield are key to success in this game by award-winning designer, John Prados.<br/><br/>Rules in Toppling the Reich include ones dealing with the various Army and Corps Commanders on both sides, Paratroop drops and airpower, a very clever depiction of ULTRA capabilities (and failures), the planning and timing for German counter-attacks. Toppling the Reich is actually six different games: five scenarios which cover the Western Front from September 1944 to April 1945 and one 36 turn Campaign Game which includes this entire period. The smaller scenarios include:<br/><br/>Scenario 1: Broad Front or Narrow Thrust? (Market-Garden) - Sept. 1-24, 1944 (four turns)<br/>Having broken out of Normandy, Allied troops capture Paris and press toward the German frontier. The Germans strive to rebuild the strength of their Fifth Panzer Army, destroyed in the Falaise Pocket, and to reconstitute a solid defense. The Allied commander has a very limited attack supply capability and must choose between attacking all along the front or concentrating for a single powerful attack.<br/><br/>Scenario 2: See Germany and Die! Closing Up to the Westwall - Sept. 25-Nov. 11, 1944 (8 turns)<br/>Against a rapidly solidifying German defense, Allied armies attempt to maximize their gains in spite of their still limited supply abilities. The full deployment of the Allied Sixth Army Group north of the Swiss border and the continued offensive stance of Patton&rsquo;s Third Army press the Germans in Lorraine back towards the Rhine. At the same time, the Americans in the center take Aachen while the British attain the line of the Meuse.<br/><br/>Scenario 3: The Roer River and Lorraine - Nov. 12-Dec. 10, 1944 (5 turns)<br/>Greatly recovered from its Normandy debacle, the German army by November 1944 is offering stiff resistance to the Allies. For their part, Allied armies attempt to clear the right bank of the Rhine in Lorraine, and to expand and secure their penetration of the Westwall at Aachen. This stage of the war sees some of the most bitter and bloody fighting in the Western Front.<br/><br/>Scenario 4: Herbstnebel-Nordwind: From the Bulge to Alsace - Dec. 11, 1944-Feb. 2, 1945 (9 turns)<br/>The Allied advance has been essentially brought to a halt before the Westwall. The German High Command made a conscious decision about their strategy for the next phase of the campaign. Adolf Hitler opts for a counter-offensive, and attacks are planned in the Ardennes and toward Strassbourg. The Germans throw their best forces into a last great gamble to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.<br/><br/>Scenario 5: The Defense of the Rhine - Feb. 4-Apr. 3, 1945 (10 turns)<br/>After the failure of the Bulge and Alsace offensives, an exhausted German army returns to the Westwall to discover that the Allies are already prepared for a bone-shattering frontal offensive. Allied troops grind through the Westwall defenses and the Germans attempt to hold the Rhine. Hitler, dissatisfied with the situation in the West, relieves his best commanders. With the end of the war nearing, an important question for the Allied Command is what kind of attack force should be brought to bear against Berlin.<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>    Two dual-side printed countersheets (480 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 20-page Toppling the Reich rulebook<br/>    One dual-side printed Toppling the Reich Special Rules Player Aid<br/>    Two single-side printed set-up Player Aid charts<br/>    Three dual-side printed 11x17&quot; scenario set-up sheets<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: 6 days<br/>    Hex: 5 miles / 8 kilometers<br/>    Units: Battalion to Corps<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-15 hours<br/><br/>',

Trial of Strength is a strategic level board wargame set in the Eastern Front of WWII, originally published by Panther Games in 1985.  A new second edition is being published by Lock 'n Load Publishing, LLC.<br/><br/>Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45 is a turn-based board wargame that puts the players in the shoes of armed forces commanders who must determine objectives, allocate forces and execute operations designed to achieve victory over your opponent.  The battlefield the game is played on is a hexagon-style 1:4,000,000 scale map of Eastern Europe with each hex represents 72 kilometres (45 miles) from side to side.  Each turn represents approximately 10 days, with 3 turns per month. Units are generally corps of the Axis and armies for the Soviet Union, both about 60,000 troops each, while also consisting of smaller battle groups of specialist formations.<br/><br/>Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45 heart comes from it's novel and sophisticated integrated movement and combat system called CLIMACS, units conduct combat during the movement phase by expending movement points.  The game is played at Corps / Army scale. There isn't a combat phase in Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45.  All combat is done somewhat like overruns in the operations phase. A unit in range of a HQ  can roll for initiative to react when a combat is declared. Each HQ gets to do this once during the opponent's turn.<br/><br/>The air and naval aspect of the game is easy.  There are Armor effects in combat and rules to allow more than one stack at a time to combine their movement. When Armor effects are used the Tanks must take the first loss if any (you will see the way those Panzers get worn down in Barbarossa). Losses are by step with possible retreats and even morale rolls to hold your ground and take more losses instead of retreating.  There is also limited intelligence with many units off the map (Army / Front markers). You can only see the top unit in a stack.<br/><br/>Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45 employs a special rule-set for the use of airborne, marine, mountain, artillery, rail-gun, rail construction NKVD and SS units.  The presence of an integrated political system into the game-play caters for historical events such as the reticence of Finland and the uprising of the Slovaks among others. While variable progress on the Western Front through the effects of Allied bombings and Partisans poses variable conditions for players.<br/><br/>",

The largest of these, located north of Kiev, erupted on 3 November as infantry and tank units of the 1st Ukrainian Front burst through the German line. Soon Soviet tank columns were racing to the distant towns of Fastov and Zhitomir, mauling several German panzers divisions hastily brought up to stem the Red tide. On 12 November, however, the Germans managed to assemble a powerful striking force centered around the 1st and 1st SS Panzer Divisions, threw them at the overextended formations of the Red Army, and rolled them back. Over the next four weeks the action see-sawed back and forth as reserves were committed and attack followed counterattack.<br/><br/>One side represents the German forces of the 4th Panzer Army while the other side controls the Red Army forces of 1st Ukrainian Front.

So be aware that it is possible that there are two different counter mixes for this game.

First installment in Moments in History's &quot;T3&quot; series, which has subsequently become the &quot;Schwerpunkt&quot; series for GMT Games. Hallmarks of the system are ease of play and the &quot;fog of war&quot; element.<br/><br/>Contrary to the playing time above this game takes about 6 hours to play unless their is an earlier sudden death decision.<br/><br/>Features C3I points used to generate the number of units that can be activated to move and the number of attacks that can be made during each segment.  There are three segments per turn in which each player must begin by deciding whether they will move and then attack or attack and then move.  Not only is combat strength compared but also a unit's tactical rating when resolving combats.  The side with the higher tactical rating gets to draw more random chits most of which have beneficial drms for that side. To a limited extent combat losses can be converted into retreats and enemy retreats can occasionally result in an additional advance for the attacker.  Occasionally, extreme die rolls allow additional spontaneous activities.  ZoCs are hard except friendly units allow tracing supply through them.  Loss of supply reduces unit effectiveness and can result in attrition.  Victory is determined mostly by units losses but also the Soviet control of objective cities and the presence of even one friendly unit on the other players side of the Donets river provides a healthy number of VPs.  Both players begin with units in this position and so cancel each other out.<br/><br/>All in all it is a tense game.  The Russian player with the benefit of hindsight can avoid many of the hazards of the original campaign by not over extending himself.<br/><br/>Republished in Command Magazine Japan #56.<br/><br/>",

        description: "&quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are &ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...&quot;<br/>&ndash; John F. Kennedy<br/><br/>In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.<br/><br/>Components (original edition):<br/><br/><br/>     228 full colour counters <br/>     22&quot;x34&quot; full colour map <br/>     103 event cards <br/>     2 six-sided dice<br/>     1 24-page rulebook<br/>     2 full colour player aid cards<br/><br/><br/>Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)<br/><br/>     260 full colour counters <br/>     22&quot;x34&quot; mounted map with revised graphics<br/>     110 event cards<br/>     2 six-sided dice<br/>     1 24-page rulebook<br/>     2 full colour player aid cards<br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system<br/>UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp; Jason Matthews<br/>MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch<br/><br/><br/>A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:<br/><br/>     Mounted map with revised graphics<br/>     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters<br/>     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)<br/>     Revised rules and player aid cards<br/>     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames<br/><br/><br/>Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:<br/><br/>     Mounted Map with revised graphics<br/>     New card decks<br/>     Updated Rules &amp; Charts<br/><br/><br/>",

Two full battles are included:<br/> Cedar Mountain<br/>August 9th, 1862.  With the Peninsular Campaign winding down, Gen. Robert E. Lee sent Maj. Gens. Stonewall Jackson and A.P. Hill to attack Maj. Gen. John Pope&rsquo;s new Federal Army of Virginia  with 27,000 troops.<br/><br/>Gen. John Pope, hoping to draw attention away from Maj. Gen. George McClellan&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Peninsula, moved against the rail junction at Gordonsville, Va.   Stonewall Jackson found USA Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks&rsquo;s division isolated.  Jackson crossed the Rapidan River to engage.  Pope ordered Brig. Gen. James Ricketts&rsquo;s division to unite with Banks&rsquo;s forces on high ground near Cedar Run, seven miles south of the town of Culpeper.  These two forces met in the afternoon heat.<br/> South Mountain<br/>September 14th, 1862.  After the CSA success at Second Bull Run Gen. Robert E. Lee believed the demoralized USA armies could not respond to any bold action.  Thusly, he planned a campaign to raid Maryland and Pennsylvania and to threaten Washington D.C. itself.  Once again Lee confidently divided his army to both move north and neutralize the large Union garrison at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.<br/><br/>However, the Union Army under Gen. George B. McClellan was quick to recover from the Bull Run defeat and was already in pursuit of Lee.  The gods of war smiled on the Union troops as a copy of Lee&rsquo;s orders fell into Union hands.  An attack through the lightly held gaps at South Mountain would cut Lee&rsquo;s army in two and perhaps end the war.  At 6:00 am the Union Army moved.<br/><br/>The Great Battles of the American Civil War Series:<br/>This series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental level Gettysburg game -Terrible Swift Sword (SPI)- designed by Richard Berg in 1976.  Under GMT, the rules system has remained stable but has shown remarkable flexibility to allow each game to smoothly incorporate additional rules to reflect the historical battles.  The series relies on interactive chit-pull mechanics to simulate the oftentimes chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield at the regimental level. <br/><br/><br/>The Game:<br/>Twin Peaks contains two battle games each with its own full size map on one double-sided mapsheet. Experienced players will be able to play either in one sitting.  Both battles highlight the effects of fatigue from the late summer heat and the difficult terrain.  The optional fatigue rules are mandatory in both battles.  The Cedar Mountain battle also includes optional units which could have joined the battle.<br/><br/><br/>',

        description: "In the fall of 1941, the German Blitzkrieg was ready for one more final grand effort: the conquest of Moscow. Code-named Typhoon, Germany expected this final offensive to destroy all Soviet armies in front of Moscow in a classic double-envelopment by the Panzer divisions. In short, the Germans expected Typhoon to end the war in the east. Spearheading the German attack was Army Group Center, General Guderian's PanzerArmee, with some 900,000 men in 70 divisions. Facing them, blocking the way to the Soviet seat of power, were over 800,000 Soviet troops in 95 divisions.<br/><br/>The German assault was ferocious and incessant and came within sight of the Moscow Kremlin. Although their attacks ripped gaping holes in the Soviet lines, the defenders did not disintegrate, as the Germans expected. After suffering huge losses in the opening battles, the Soviets reinforced the front line with Siberian and other reserves numbering perhaps 1.2 million men.<br/><br/>The battle for Moscow proved to be one of the decisive battles of the Second World War.<br/>Now, you can replay this epic struggle for supremacy in the east. The game's easy-to-play system allows the players to focus on the critical matters of operational maneuver and force coordination, while adding just enough chrome to faithfully recreate the key elements of the campaign.

        description: "Tyrant is a tactical simulation of combat between the armies of Carthage and Syracuse, from 480-276 B.C.<br/><br/>Long before Hannibal Barca led the armed forces of Carthage into a titanic struggle with Rome, Carthage had vied for centuries with the Greek city-state of Syracuse for supremacy in the Western Meditteranean. Tyrant includes twelve of the most decisive battles in the recurring wars that pitted Carthage against the Greeks of Syracuse. The armies of Syracuse were similar to the contemporary hoplite armies of the mainland Greek city-states, but with better cavalry and a strong mercenary corps of both Greek and Western barbarian units. Carthage relied on North African tribal levies augmented with barbarian mercenaries from all over the Western Mediterranean. In Sicily, Carthaginian armies were usually supported by allied and mercenary Greek units.<br/><br/>Although Syracuse was generally more successful in open field battles, Carthage had superior wealth, political stability, and naval power. The continued warfare remained balanced over time, yielding no decisive advantage to either side. The more than two centuries long struggle never came to a definite conclusion as &quot;new kid on the block&quot; Rome would emerge in the First Punic War to steal the prize.<br/><br/>Battles:<br/><br/>    Himera, 480BC<br/>    Second Himera, 409BC<br/>    Akrgas, 406BC<br/>    Gela, 405BC<br/>    Cabala, 377BC<br/>    Cronium, 376BC<br/>    Crimissos River, 341BC<br/>    Abolus River, 338BC<br/>    Mount Ecnomious, 311BC<br/>    White Tunis, 310BC<br/>    Tunis, 307BC<br/>    Lilybaeum, 276BC<br/><br/><br/>To play Tyrant, you will need the game Great Battles of Alexander, Deluxe Edition for maps, basic rules, and some counters.

        description: "On August 3rd, 1943, less than two weeks after the Kursk offensive, the Soviets launched a massive offensive near Kharkov that ripped open the German line. The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to the Dnieper River.<br/>During August the two sides were equally matched and a tremendous war of attrition raged from Kharkov to the Sea of Azov with neither side willing to give ground. In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough. Three Soviet Tank Armies and four Soviet Fronts ground through nineteen panzer and panzergrenadier divisions. German and Soviet losses were staggering. Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, fell on November 6th.<br/><br/><br/>[1st edition]<br/><br/>Ukraine '43 attempts to simulate this important campaign in a moderately complex game. The design uses the conventional move-fight-exploit sequence of play and the popular Zone of Control Bond rules.

        description: "&quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; was the wargame in issue #36 of The Wargamer Magazine dated December 1984.<br/><br/>The game simulates the Confederate counterattack on Fort Donelson after the Fort had been invested by U.S. Grant and the Union army in February 1862. The Confederate garrison actually outnumbered the Union troops 18,000 to 15,000, but Grant's judgement of his opponent's psychology served him well. The unconditional surrender of the fort on Febuary 16th, 1862, shattered the Confederate defenses in western and middle Tennessee.The equivalent of an entire corps was taken prisoner, and the Cumberland River was opened to the Union Navy. Within weeks Nashville would fall and the remaining Confederate forces would retreat into Mississippi. The victory made a national hero of it's previously unknown author, who here began his rise to command of all the Union armies - U.S. Grant. Yet the battle could have turned out much differently, and the controversy in later years over what really happened and why, would be among the most intense surrounding any action of the war.<br/><br/>",

        description: "Under the Lily Banners is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the Thirty Years War. This is the third volume from the award winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series detailing 17th Century warfare, often known as the Dawn of Modern Warfare. This volume features the rise of the French Army after their entry into the Thirty Years War in 1635. Two of the greatest captains of French history - Louis de Bourbon, the Grand Cond&eacute; and Henri de la Tour, the vicomte de Turenne - take the field to set the stage for Le Grand Siecle - the Golden Age of France under Louis XIV, the Sun King.<br/><br/>After taking on the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War and the combined arms tactics of the Swedes and Imperials in Sweden Fights On, the Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series looks at the French, Spanish and Bavarian armies. The Spanish tercios face the superb French gendarmes. The stalwart Bavarians with their excellent cavalry and love of entrenchments battle the veteran Weimarian cavalry corps.<br/><br/>Armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player that can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include cavalry charges, cavalry pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The five battles in Under the Lily Banners are:<br/><br/>Rocroi 1643 - The debut of the young duc d'Enghien (later known as the Grand Cond&eacute;). The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War that broke the power of the Spanish tercios. The French faced a larger Spanish army but the energetic Enghien refused to quit when all seemed lost and snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.<br/><br/>Freiburg 1644 - Enghien joined forces with Turenne facing the well entrenched Bavarians. The battle raged for over 3 days until the French were worn down. The French declared victory then bypassed the town. A very different style of battle than any other from the period due to the terrain, style of attack, and duration.<br/><br/>Mergentheim 1645 - The Bavarians surprised Turenne's army and inflicted a stinging blow. This is the smallest battle in the series and is included as a learning scenario.<br/><br/>Alerheim aka Second N&ouml;rdlingen 1645 - Turenne, reinforced by Enghien and German Allies from Hesse-Cassel, again faced the entrenched Bavarians. The Bavarians, reinforced by the Imperials, held two hills and the town. Enghien attacked the town and Turenne, at the head of the elite Weimarian cavalry corps, attacked the Bavarian right. The excellent cavalry commander for the Bavarians, Jean de Werth, saw Enghien's attack bog down in the town and attacked the French right, smashing it. The French were losing until the Bavarian commander, Franz von Mercy, fell and in the confusion, allowing Turenne to pull out a victory. The casualties were so heavy the French ended the campaign season three months early.<br/><br/>Lens 1648 - The resurgent Spanish under the Archduke Leopold brother of the Holy Roman Emperor pressed into Flanders to recapture the fortress of Lens. With domestic unrest and a military failure in Spain, the French seemed vulnerable. The Grand Cond&eacute; rushed to the rescue. The Spanish took the high ground, hoping Cond&eacute; would attack as he had at Alerheim. Instead, he turned and began to retire. A cavalry skirmish with the French rearguard escalated and drew both armies into the action piecemeal. The veteran Spanish tercios smashed the elite gardes fran&ccedil;aises, taking their colors as revenge for Rocroi. The French cavalry proved superior and drove off the Spanish horse, leaving the body of infantry isolated on the field where they surrendered en masse. This shattered the last hopes for the Habsburgs, ending their involvement in the Thirty Years War with a defeat.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>1 series rulebook<br/>1 playbook<br/>3 countersheets<br/>2 backprinted mapsheets (3 one map battles and 2 half-map battles)<br/>1 die<br/>Player Aid Cards<br/><br/>Nominee for the 2005 Charles S.

        description: "Unhappy King Charles! allows two players to decide whether Commons or Cavalier shall rule in England. Both seek to establish control over the country and of its economic structures. They seek not only to defeat their opponents in battle but also to seize control of the local government of England and Wales.<br/><br/>This Strategic level Card-Driven board-wargame is based on We the People, Mark Herman's ingenious game on a later rebellion. As the organization of armies and states was often desultory, the cards do not provide a wide range of choices (as in Paths of Glory). The players in Unhappy King Charles! must make do with what they have. The three decks of cards - Early(1642-1643), Middle(1644) and Late (1645)- have been developed to give the correct feel for the early, middle and late war, based on storyboarding techniques. As befits a Civil War, there is treachery, bravery and stupidity in the events on the cards.<br/><br/>Unhappy King Charles! is played over eleven turns, each representing about four months. Brigades of troops are used to form Armies (defined Rule 3) or garrisons of fortresses (Rule 13). Only unled Brigades are on the map; the others are placed on the box of their General on the Command Displays. Generals move on the maps.<br/><br/>The Armies of Unhappy King Charles! are temporary massings of troops that have as much to do with feudal armies as modern revolutionaries. With inadequate supply and poor equipment it is not surprising that these armies suffer from continual desertion; and in using them you are going to have to ensure they wander the map collecting fresh recruits. Armies can be over 30,000 for a vital siege or battle or 3,000 tough cavalry under Prince Rupert or Black Tom Fairfax.<br/><br/>Movement activations are initiated via a numbered Ops Card, as in We the People, and are based on Army size. The smaller the Army the faster it can move. Movement across the map is by means of Areas joined by movement lines. Control of areas can change during movement if movement points are spent. Non-moving Armies can attempt interception, placing themselves in the path of the moving Army to cause Battle.<br/><br/>The game's basic combat unit is the Brigade, which comes in two types: Veterans (value 2) and militia (value 1). Usually militia units must be recruited before veterans of that Region. Each Region's Areas and Brigades use the same basic colour system. Fresh Brigades are received by Recruitment, which is usually limited to the unit's region of origin. Brigades lost in combat are not available for recruitment (though some Event Cards can bring them back); other losses are available.<br/><br/>Leader counters are either Generals (with a Strategic and Battle Rating) or Local Notables (Governors of fortresses). Generals can be Field Generals (who operate everywhere) or Regional Generals who can suffer disadvantages when outside their Region. Generals cannot transfer Brigades to other Generals (unless Event Cards require), Brigades remain with their original General until death, dispersal or desertion takes them. Local Notables can transfer Brigades to other friendly Generals.<br/><br/>Battles use the Combat Value of Brigades, General's Battle Ratings and Combat Cards to resolve combat. But before any Battle is fought one side can try to Evade (leave the Area) or Disperse (remove itself before combat). Losses in combat are not available for recruitment. Drawn and Decisive Victories will kill Veteran Brigades (if there are any) first. The loser must retreat and can suffer further losses if he retreats through enemy PC Markers. Major and Decisive Victories earn extra Cards.<br/><br/>Fortresses cover a wide range of locations. They are ranked by class and must be forced to Surrender by Siege or Event Card. Siege requires the attention of an Army for some time (most Fortresses will require more than one activation to capture). If attacked during that time the besieger can have to abandon the Siege. Assaults can be attempted (at a cost in losses).<br/><br/>The game can be won by an Automatic Victory, by one side failing to control enough Areas, or at the end of the eleventh turn.<br/><br/>For those players who like some counter-factuals a pack of would-be events is provided. Now players can use Dutch squadrons to blockade the King, summon the Duke of Lorraine, or cause a rising in London. As an Optional Rule, four events are drawn each game and shuffled into the middle and late decks.<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>     110 Cards<br/>     One 34&quot; x 22&quot; colour paper game map<br/>     Two full-color counter sheets<br/>     One 28 Page Rulebook<br/>     One 24 page Playbook<br/>     Two 11' x 8.5' Player Aid Cards<br/>     Two Six-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Cover artwork inspired by Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641)<br/><br/>",

        description: "Veracruz: U.S. Invasion of Mexico, was originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #63. Veracruz is an operational simulation of General Winfield Scott's Mexican campaign, which took place between March and September 1847. The invasion was an American effort to end the Mexican War by marching into the heart of Central Mexico to capture the capital, Mexico City. Diplomatically, it ended the decades of border disputes and opened up vast new territories, which in turn led to the Gold Rush of '49 and the Great Compromise of 1850.<br/><br/>European commanders and military experts, when viewing the upcoming conflict in 1846, could not see anything but a complete Mexican victory, given the size of her army with it's European system of training and assembly. But the European System was a hollow shell that worked with even less validity in the rigid hierarchical Mexican social structure. The entire system was exacerbated by a succession of generals and other leaders who were inept on a scale that dwarfs even the darkest Union days of the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the best generals of the American Civil War distinguished themselves here as lieutenants and captains: Robert E. Lee (engineers, Scott's chief scout), Ulysses S. Grant, George Pickett, Thomas J. Jackson, Braxton Bragg, Jubal Early, George G. Meade, Phillip Kearney, David D. Porter (USN), and Jefferson Davis, to name a few.<br/><br/>The map depicts central Mexico down to Mexico City, the target of the American player. Players have to deal with supply and a complex set of morale rules. Counters represent basic units, horses, naval units, leaders and a US dummy unit. Other counters indicate supply, unit effectiveness, fortifications, cities and various status counters.<br/><br/>Special rules for Yellow Fever ( 2000 U.S. soldiers died in combat conditions but over 11,000 died of disease), Limited Intelligence, Morale, Mexican Political Climate, Navy Gunboats, and Mexican Guerrillas.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: 5 miles<br/>Units: Company to Regiments<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 21 x 33&quot; map<br/>One countersheet (200 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>One 26-page Rules booklet<br/><br/>",

        description: "Victory in the West: Plan Yellow, The French Campaign 1940, is a realistic two-player game that accurately recreates the 1940 campaign in all its aspects except one: the outcome is totally up to you. The game's centerpiece is an options system that lets the Allied player trade Victory Points for changes to his armies and policies that might (or might not) have changed history. Can you, as the Allied commander, repel the Germans with the forces on hand in 1940? How about if you train them better? Or give them a better command structure? Or provide them with more and better anti-aircraft an anti-tank guns? What do you think is the key to victory in the west? Can you, as the German commander, still beat the Allies if the French Army is motorized like the BEF? And how does your strategy change if the French don't build their Maginot Line, but do build a bigger and better air force? Do you still try to sneak through the Ardennes forest with your Panzers? Or do you ignore Allied bombers and wheel across the open plains of northern Belgium in a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan? Or do you do the unexpected and land a left hook through the Alsace? Your commanders await your orders. The future of Europe is in your hands.<br/><br/>10 May, 1940 ... The German Wehrmacht opened its long-awaited campaign in the West by smashing across the frontiers of Belgium and Holland. For the German High Command, it was seen as a daring move. Hitler's fledgling legions faced the combined armies of France, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. These Allied forces had more and better weapons of almost every type, and at least two of the opposing armies, those of France and Britain, were considered to be the best in the world. The Germans had the element of surprise and the new Blitzkrieg tactics of mobile warfare.<br/><br/>Six weeks later, it was all over. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been driven from the continent and the French, Belgians, and Dutch had all capitulated. Hitler had achieved a victory in the west, and the world would never be the same.<br/><br/>But, what if? It didn't have to happen that way ... Bad generalship and correctable flaws in their armies hastened the Allied defeat. What if the High Command had bothered to stay in radio contact with its armies on the frontier? And had then reacted promptly to the developing situation? What if the Maginot Line had been extended to cover the Meuse crossings at Sedan where Guderian's Panzers broke into the Allied rear? What if the BEF had included a strong British mobile corps that could have fought Rommel's Panzers on even terms at Arras? What if the French had prepared to meet the Blitzkrieg by building eight tank divisions instead of three? Or by mechanizing their cavalry the way the Germans did after the Polish campaign?

This was one of the longest and most intense battles of the 1968 Tet Offensive. Hue has two scenarios. The Standard scenario covers the first stage of the battle. The Extended scenario follows the fighting all the way through to the final Allied victory. Both scenarios are set up in the same way.<br/><br/>Operation Pegasus simulates the operations surrounding the U.S. Marine Corps firebase at Khe Sanh. The game has two scenarios. The Lang Vei scenario starts with the Communist assault which overran the Lang Vei Special Forces camp and includes the possibility of a fullscale Communist assault on Khe Sanh itself. The Relief scenario covers the airmobile attackby the U.S. First Cavalry Division (Airmobile) which relieved Khe Sanh. Each Pegasus Scenario has separate deployment instructions and victory conditions.<br/><br/>The Vietnam Battles game system is a grand tactical simulation of combat during the Indochina Wars. Each game in the system represents a major battle between Allied and Communist forces. The playing pieces represent the a&uuml;tual units which participated in the battles. The maps represent the terrain over which those units fought.<br/><br/>Several key factors of Vietnam War operations are simulated, including the interaction of conventional and guerrilla forces, firepower versus mobility, and the utilization of helicopters and airpower. There are two players. One represents the Communists (Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army); the other the Allies (United States, South Vietnam, and others).<br/><br/>The rules are divided into the Standard Rules, which are common to all games in the system and the Exclusive Rules, which provide deployment, reinforcement and . victory instructions for each specific battle. The standardization of rules makes it easier for the gamer to play games within the series. Certain rules are designated Optional.

        description: "Vinegar Joe's War: CBI (China-Burma-India Theater of Operations) is a wargame of the World War II campaign in Southeast Asia: Malaya, Burma, Indochina and adjoining areas of India and China. In that campaign the Japanese overran Malaya, captured the strategic British base of Singapore and conquered Burma. Later campaigns saw the Japanese-Allied struggle for the Indian Frontier, the deployment of the Chindits, and the final Japanese grasp during the Imphal campaign, followed by the Allied counter-attack that won victory in the theater.<br/><br/>CBI is intended to be a simple game: it allows for the completion of the entire four year campaign within 16 turns.  It includes all critical operations, however: land and air warfare, special operations and logistical considerations. The game has two players: the Allied and the Japanese.  Players conduct operations with their units in their own turns. The objective of the game is to capture strategic locales and destroy enemy units.<br/><br/>Game scale: Each map hex equals 60 kilometers. Each turn represents three months of operations. Each airstrike represents one or two British wings, US groups or Japanese air regiments.<br/><br/>The game includes three scenarios. Scenario 1, &quot;Singapore to Calcutta&quot; is the campaign game, 1941 - 1945 (16 turns). Scenario 2 covers the last Japanese offensive in Southeast Asia: &quot;Imphal&quot;. Scenario 3 is a short scenario entitled &quot;Fall of an Empire&quot; and covers only the first few turns of the war, through the 1942-III turn. In addition there are two scenario variants, &quot;Operation Zipper&quot; and &quot;Historic Withdrawals&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        description: "from GMT website:<br/><br/>Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is a game of grand strategy for two to six players based on the military, political and religious conflicts within Europe during the reigns of Elizabeth I of England and Philip II of Spain. Each player controls one or more of the major powers that presided over European politics in that day. Spain is the juggernaut, able to draw upon the vast riches of their global empire. But such a dominant power is sure to have many enemies. The Ottoman expansion towards Spain's Mediterranean outposts remains unchecked. Elizabeth's English sea dogs are poised to raid Spain's overseas empire. And the forces of Protestant reform will soon drag Spain into eighty years of rebellion in the Netherlands. Will Spain find aid from its Catholic allies? Perhaps not from France, where the Catholic Valois dynasty is soon to engage another group of Protestant believers in the bloody French Wars of Religion. And even Philip's relatives in Vienna who rule the Holy Roman Empire may dabble in the Protestant faith instead of remaining loyal to their Catholic heritage and Spanish brethren.<br/><br/>The six powers in Virgin Queen are:<br/><br/>     Ottoman<br/>     Spain<br/>     England<br/>     France<br/>     Holy Roman Empire<br/>     Protestants (Dutch &amp; Huguenots)<br/><br/><br/>Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is the sequel to Here I Stand, another card-driven game of grand strategy that covered the previous forty years (from Martin Luther's posting of his 95 Theses in 1517 through the abdication of Charles V in 1556). Players familiar with Here I Stand will find much that is familiar in Virgin Queen as over half of the rule book remains unchanged. New game systems have been put in place to emphasize the changing nature of the conflicts here in the late 16th Century:<br/><br/><br/>     Religion: Streamlined from Here I Stand, the new rules for religious conversion and rebellion allow actions to be resolved quickly, reflecting the already entrenched presence of both Catholic and Protestant factions across the key areas of religious struggle.<br/>     World Map: Oceanic expeditions are now under direct player control as they sail to the Caribbean and beyond to seize plunder, found colonies, and attempt to circumnavigate the globe.<br/>     Diplomatic Influence: Alliances with minor powers (and major powers that can be activated in games with fewer than six players) are now made through a unified system where players buy influence at each of these foreign courts.<br/>     Weddings: Here I Stand&rsquo;s secret negotiation phase is still present here in Virgin Queen, but with a new twist. Now you will want to arrange marriages for each of the princes and princesses of your family dynasty with a suitable foreign royal. Will even the Virgin Queen succumb to love and take a husband, or will she jilt that suitor at the last minute once again?<br/>     Patronage: Your royal court will be visited by artists, writers, scientists, and architects, who all want you to invest in their endeavors for the glory and advancement of the realm. Will you sponsor Galileo, Cervantes, or Shakespeare or instead spend your treasury on a fruitless quest for the Philosopher's Stone?<br/>     Espionage: Beware, there is also a dark side to this period &ndash; a time of espionage and spymasters. In Virgin Queen you can ask your ambassadors to spy on foreign courts, send out handgun-armed assassins, invest in cryptology, and even recruit Jesuit priests for undercover missions of conversion. <br/><br/><br/>There are several different scenarios included allowing your play sessions to be tailored to the number of players and time available:<br/><br/>     Two-Player Tutorial: Great for new players just learning the series, this 90-minute game pits the Ottomans against Spain during the time of the Siege of Malta and Battle of Lepanto. Uses a subset of the full rules so you can dive in quickly.<br/>     Campaign Scenario: The full Virgin Queen experience, this eight-hour game can last up to seven turns and is normally played with from 4 to six players. Variant rules allow you to play with just two or three players if desired.<br/>     Armada Scenario: A quicker game focused on Turns 3 to 6 of the full campaign, this 4 to 5-hour game is ideal for tournament play. Once again supports from 4 to 6 players.<br/><br/><br/>",

        description: "Southern Russia, early February 1943 -- In Stalingrad, the surrounded remnants of the once might German Sixth Army are being slowly and methodically exterminated. Hundreds of miles to the west, two powerful Soviet Fronts are moving west and south against a patchwork German line, intent on destroying the remaining Axis forces in Southern Russia. Operations Star and Gallop have begun.<br/><br/>Six weeks later, the shocked, battered remnants of these two Soviet Fronts are running for the collective lives from powerful German panzer spearheads. What had happened? Soviet overconfidence was responsible in part for the disaster, playing into German hands, but by far, most of the credit for the amazing reversal belonged to Field Marshal von Manstein. Holding off the Soviets to his front and Hitler at his back, he managed to accumulate sufficient panzer formations to allow the Germans to regain tactical and operational superiority.<br/><br/>Von Manstein's Backhand Blow is a low/intermediate complexity two player game using the well-received Turning the Tables system pioneered in earlier east front games produced by Moments in History. The game system itself is easy to learn and master. No two games will ever play out alike because a great deal of uncertainty and randomness is injected into each combat due to the Combat Chit Draw and Random Events Table. This uncertainty makes Von Manstein's Backhand Blow ideal as a solitaire game since combat results cannot be accurately predicted.<br/><br/>Dirk Blennemann, the designer, has the reputation for creating excellent Orders of Battle for East Front simulations. Using detailed Russian and German language sources, he provides a broad array of maneuver units - Soviet division and corps on one side, and German units ranging from regiments down to the multitude of ad hoc German kampfgruppen thrown into the battle to stop the Soviet advance.<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/>TIME SCALE     2 days per turn<br/>MAP SCALE     8km per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE     Soviet corps and divisions; German regiments, kampgruppen, and battalion-sized<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS     One or two<br/><br/>(from GMT website)<br/><br/>",

The rules for each individual corps action are described on the cards. The results of these actions are then recorded on the battlefield map.

        description: "In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA).<br/><br/>Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.<br/><br/>The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice-versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).<br/><br/>Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>    War of the Ring Collector's Edition<br/>    War of the Ring: Second Edition<br/><br/><br/>Upgrade to the 2nd edition (Card Pack) <br/><br/>    War of the Ring (second edition): Upgrade Kit<br/><br/><br/>",

Tolkien&rsquo;s The Lord of the Rings and create their own version of the dramatic conflict between the Dark Lord, Sauron, and the Free Peoples of Middle-earth.<br/>In War of the Ring: The Card Game, up to 4 players compete in two teams, the Shadow against the Free Peoples, each player using a specific and different card deck representing the strengths and weaknesses of the different factions involved in the war.<br/>The Free Peoples desperately try to complete their quest to destroy the One Ring, while at the same time defending their homelands from the encroaching hordes of Sauron and from his evil allies.<br/><br/>The Shadow players must strike quickly and decisively, before the Ring-bearers can complete their quest; or try to slowly corrupt Frodo, burdening him with wounds, toil, and the sorrow for the loss of his Companions.<br/><br/>During the game, players will take turns playing cards representing the characters, armies, items, and events of the War of the Ring. Each card they play will help or hinder the journey of the Fellowship as it progresses on its Path; or be used to defend or conquer the strongholds of Middle-earth, as they fight to control the new Battleground cards activated in each round.<br/><br/>With more than 100 original illustrations from the greatest Tolkienian artists in the world, including an amazing gallery of landscapes from The Shire to Mordor by John and Fataneh Howe, War of the Ring: The Card Game is more than a game &ndash; it also a memorable collection for all lovers of the world imagined by J.R.R.

        description: 'The Triple Alliance War (TAW) is a two-player, low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic-level simulation of the second-largest war ever fought in the New World (the largest having been the American Civil War). The Paraguayan player is attempting to hold off the onslaught of three allied nations: Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. The Allied player is generally on the offensive, attempting to win the game by invading Paraguay and seizing key areas on map within that country. The Paraguayan player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also allows for his prosecution of offensives, particularly in the early stage of the war.<br/><br/>Game play encompasses the period that began historically in 1865 with the Paraguayans launching a preemptive strike into Argentine territory. The game ends during the first half of 1868 when, historically, the Allies broke through the Paraguayan river forts and went on to seize their capital. That advance signaled the ultimate doom of the Paraguayan cause and, though the war officially went on for another year and a half, that portion of it was more a rebellion-and-occupation struggle than an actual war.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 15.5 miles (25 km) from side to opposite side. The ground units of maneuver for both sides are primarily battalions, along with some nominal &quot;brigades&quot; and &quot;divisions,&quot; which are actually all really battalion-equivalents themselves. Each riverine unit represents on naval combat vessel or several armed rafts or transport ships. Game Turn 1 represents three months, while each one after that represents half a year.<br/><br/>',

It is a chess variant with the board expanded to 12 x 12 squares. Follow-up variants in the next two issues of Command added a some interesting variant pieces with new moves and powers and a whole different chess-like game based on 20th Century military units, none of which got the attention it deserved because of the outrage and bad feeling left over from the initial impression. For chess players some interesting ideas, many of which have been seen before in one form or another.

Washington's War, like its predecessor, pits the forces of a world power (England) against its rebellious American colonists as they fight for their independence.<br/><br/>Washington&rsquo;s War is a true re-design that maintains the deep strategy of We the People while creating a game with a very short playing time (approximately 90 minutes). Unlike most wargames, Washington's War allows you and your opponent to play twice while switching sides in one sitting. This feature allows for rapid tournament play either face-to-face or on the Internet. Washington's War is the perfect antidote for a time conscious crowd whose only option up to now have been Eurogames.<br/><br/>Washington&rsquo;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to Internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that makes every card in your hand playable by allowing your opponent to buy his discarded events for an operations card. Now, unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers for advancing your strategy.<br/><br/>The biggest design changes between We the People and Washington's War, besides the aforementioned new game mechanics, is the increased emphasis on the asymmetrical capabilities of the two sides. The British are a conventional army with a dominant naval capability that gives them great strengths in the coastal regions. The Americans are an unconvential force with a small Contintental Army led by George Washington who yearn for French intervention. While the British struggle to expand their influence inland, the Americans struggle to keep their militia forces in the field. In the end it is the side that is better able to play to their strengths and protect their vulnerabilities that prevails in Washington's War.<br/><br/>Washington&rsquo;s War was broadly tested on the Internet in a tournament format to ensure clarity of rules under the stresses of competition.

In Washington&rsquo;s War, you assume the role of either:<br/><br/><br/>     The King of Great Britain as he tries to bring his rebellious colonies back into the Empire, while at the same time dealing with a global war against ancient enemies bent on revenge for their losses in the Seven Years War; OR<br/>     The Continental Congress as they battle the forces of Britain, while trying to rally their countrymen to the cause of liberty.<br/><br/><br/>Washington&rsquo;s War is not just a re-tread of my earlier design on the same subject, but a true re-design that is keeping the basic feel while simplifying and speeding up what was already a fast paced game. Washington&rsquo;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that enables a player to play a discarded event for the cost of an operations card.

Although only a single deck of strategy cards is used, &agrave; la We the People, the two sides are dramatically different in character: the French are irregular-heavy (especially Indians) and rely on raiding to tie down the superior numbers of British Regular &amp; Provincial drilled troops, who will themselves be intent on sieges and trying to force a pitched battle. Like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, the fortunes of war turn as the game goes on: the French are masters early, with the crushing British manpower advantage accruing late.<br/><br/>Wilderness War takes two players into the French &amp; Indian War, 1755-1760, the climactic struggle between France and Britain for control of North America. It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.<br/><br/>Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians. Relive the history of this exciting time when the fate of Canada hung in the balance.<br/><br/>Wilderness War is by the designer of the more recent Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 – ? and Andean Abyss and other Series: COIN (GMT) games.<br/><br/>",

There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins.<br/><br/>Description of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:<br/><br/>A game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.<br/><br/>Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:<br/><br/>Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added &quot;rule&quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of &quot;0&quot;, you must say &quot;Loco!&quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical.<br/><br/>Description of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:<br/><br/>This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns. In 2014, Gryphon Games released a new edition of this game as Wildlife Safari, featuring the same components and artwork but changing the title of the game.<br/><br/>",

Although dice play a part in the game there is plenty of room for skillful maneuvering in the course of each race, which can be from 5 furlongs to 1 1/4 miles.  An important part of the game is provided by certain marked squares: if you can get your horse to stop on one of these it can overtake one horse ahead of it in the same line, which can be vital considering that only two swerves are permitted in each turn (only one if the jockey is an apprentice).  Every horse has a distinctive racing pattern (slow or fast starter, stayer or fader etc.) represented by a set of numbers, one for each turn.  These numbers are added to a single dice throw (common to all the horses), so that the speed of each race can vary substantially.  There are many other interesting factors too numerous to describe in a short review.  Odds on each horse are pre-set and depend largely on the number patterns described above.<br/><br/>Originally released as part of the 3M Sports Games line.<br/><br/>',

        description: "Wintergewitter: The Doomed Attempt to Relieve Stalingrad, is the first in the Campaign Study Series.  It depicts the attack by the German 57th Panzerekorps to open a corridor to the 6th Army, trapped in the Stalingrad Kessel. The fierce battle, that took place between December 12-23, 1942, was not a foregone conclusion. The fate of 20 German divisions hung in the balance&mdash;and the loss of 6th Army would turn the tide in the Eastern Front.<br/><br/>The German player must use his initial advantage to open a corridor to 6th Army. The Soviet player will react quickly, but must first withstand a powerful enemy attack before he can bring powerful reinforcements to bear.<br/><br/>The game scale is two miles per hex. Each turn represents 12 hours. Units vary in size from Companies to Army (headquarters only). Designer Mark Stille performed intensive research during the design. The German OOB is drawn from the actual War Diary of the 4th Panzerarmee and from the incomparable &quot;Stalingrad&quot; by Manfred Kehrig, a detailed German-language book on the subject. The USSR OOB is drawn from a superb 1943 Soviet General Staff study, and the Kehrig work.<br/><br/>Soviet units vary from half-strength Rifle Divisions of 51st Army to the powerful formations of 2nd Guards Army.

        description: "The war raged across Germany from 1618 to 1630 with the Habsburg, Holy Roman Emperor retaining the upperhand. Then the tide of war changed when King Gustav Adolf of Sweden, the &quot;Lion of the North,&quot; revitalized the cause of the Protestant princes of Germany. Bankrolled by France, the Swedes pushed their advantage towards the Emperor's most valuable ally, Maximilian of Bavaria. Though Catholic, France sought to keep the power of the Habsburgs in check by financially supporting the Swedish King.<br/><br/>From 1632 to 1648, Bavaria and the surrounding area became a crucial battlefront to knocking Bavaria out of the war. The Swedes enjoyed success until fate removed their King and their over-extended forces could not hold onto their gains. After the Swedes suffered a sharp defeat at N&ouml;rdlingen in 1634, France was forced to play a more active role or lose all she had paid for. A series of seesaw campaigns ensued as the French Arm&eacute;e d'Allemagne secured crossings of the Rhine and pushed the war back into the heart of Bavaria. The area became the proving ground of the greatest generals of the age - Turenne, Cond&eacute;, Mercy, de Werth. Neither side possessed a clear superiority of forces so it was a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, march, counter-march, siege, and surprise attacks. After several years, a combined French-Swedish campaign finally broke the back of the Bavarians in 1646 and Maximilian made a separate peace. It did not last long; after a year he reluctantly rejoined the Imperial cause. Repeating the winning combination of 1646, the French-Swedish army ended Maximilian's enterprise at Zusmarshausen in 1648.<br/><br/>Won by the Sword is the first game in Ben Hull's Great Campaigns of the Thirty Years War series. It is a two-player game of operational warfare in the 17th Century. Armies maneuver on a point to point map of Southern Germany based on the road network available at the time. Each game is centered around a major battle or full campaign season. A Turn is a month divided into a variable number of impulses. Each army has a hand of Campaign Cards that control the amount of activity it may perform, the supplies it must expend, and a special action. Each impulse features one card play per army. Forces are concealed off map so players are faced with limited knowledge of the enemy. The major activities are maneuver, foraging, besieging fortifications, and an occasional battle. Won by the Sword is a low-complexity game with emphasis on the players maneuvering their forces, but many decisions await. The low rules complexity allows each player, rather than being encumbered with rules, to focus on choices regarding how to manage his campaign.<br/><br/>",

        description: "(from GMT Games:)<br/><br/>Spring 1941: Nazi Germany is triumphant. Poland has long since vanished from the map. Denmark, Norway, and the Low Countries have been overrun. France, the victor of 1918, has fallen. Greece and Yugoslavia have now been crushed. Britain stands alone, freed from the threat of invasion by the courage and skill of its air force and navy. But Britain is stalked and assaulted by the Nazi wolfpacks, and in North Africa a mixed garrison of British and Commonwealth forces is besieged in Tobruk by Rommel and his Afrika Korps.<br/><br/>Then, on June 22, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Stalin's Soviet Union. As the panzer spearheads slice through the bewildered Russian defenders, it appears that nothing can halt the Nazi tide. But the course of History has just taken a major turn. The Last European War is over; World War II has begun. It will end four years later, in a bunker in the ruins of Berlin.<br/><br/>World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin covers those four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich. Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his award-winning WWI strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe.<br/><br/>As in Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin uses a point to point map, this time covering all of Europe from France to the Urals, and from Norway to North Africa. Units are armies and corps (fronts and armies for the Soviets), and each turn represents three months. The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45.<br/><br/>As in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players). Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event. Events include:<br/><br/><br/>    Individual leaders (Patton, Guderian, or Rommel the Desert Fox) <br/>    Tactical innovations and new weapons (Fortified boxes, Tiger tanks) <br/>    Strategic Warfare (U-boats, Bomber Command, the 8th Airforce) <br/>    Reinforcements (Soviet Mechanized Fronts, PanzerArmee Afrika, Patton's Third Army) <br/>    Allied Invasions, actual or potential (Torch, Sledgehammer, Husky, Overlord) <br/>    Politics and Diplomacy (Hitler Declares War, Casablanca, Yalta, Operation Axis) <br/>    Irregular Warfare (Partisans, the Maquis, Otto Skorzeny)<br/><br/><br/>World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war; from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them, but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs. And unlike many of those games, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game. The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire.<br/><br/>It is June 22, 1941: Will WWII end in German triumph in Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin? As the world holds its breath, the decisions are yours.<br/><br/>",

Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc.  Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible.  When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.<br/><br/>The traditional (public domain) game Yacht predates the trademarked game, and has slightly different scoring.<br/><br/>There are four basic scoring difference between the tradition game Yacht and Yahtzee.  They are:  1) Yacht has no Three of a Kind category, 2) there are no bonuses in Yacht, 3) there are no Joker rules in Yacht, and 4) the Full House category is scored as the sum of the dice.  The other scoring rules are identical between the two games.<br/><br/>Travel versions of the game use a device that keeps the dice captured within compartments of a plastic box and allows players to &quot;lock&quot; a particular die between rolls.<br/><br/>",

Thus, the UN forces were badly overextended when the bluff materialized as a force of thirty divisions, having infiltrated into the Korean mountains.<br/><br/>UN forces were sent reeling back to the 38th Parallel in confusion, attempting to reestablish a front line. The Communists followed relentlessly, infiltrating deep into UN positions. They attacked without caution, accepting high casualties in order to sustain momentum.<br/><br/>Units in Yalu are mostly divisions, with some regiments and battalions. Ground scale is 10 miles per hex and turns are weekly. Weather plays a predominant role, influencing movement and combat options for both sides. Yalu, like no other game, effectively shows the differences in the opposing sides' Rules of Engagement - the two sides simply feel and play differently.<br/><br/>This is the second edition of Yalu; the first was published in GDW's Conflict Games line in 1977.

        description: "The eternal turning of the seasons has come full cycle once again. Spring in the hight country enters with a wash of fresh green and the warming chinook, while the show still lies deep on the mountain peaks. As the snow recedes, wild flowers of every hue splash across the lush meadows of the Northern Rockies. The small life in burrow and den creep forth, the birds sing loudly in the pines. Spring is the true beginning of the new year in the awakening wilderness of the Yellowstone.<br/><br/>The old buck raises his head and turns his gaze to the horizon. The time has come - now to lead the herd to the summer pasture where the bounty of this land will drive away the hunger of winter past. But other animals have come forth from their dens with the spring - the coyote, grizzly bear, mountain lion, and the deadliest predator of all - Man. The natural dangers of this magnificent, rugged land loom ahead. Yet the herd, to prosper, must take to the well-worn trail, seeking to cross the migratory paths of the other grazing masses. As the young gambol and explore, every instinct of the old buck must be devoted to the trek. Without hesitation, he takes the first step toward the future.<br/><br/>Yellowstone is a less complex game dealing with moving your herd from Winter Pasturage to Summer Pasturage back to Winter Pasturage.  Players control one of the following herds: bison, elk, sheep, or mule deer.  Along the way, you try to pick up Food Points and avoid predators.  You can move the animals in your herd a certain number of hexes in a turn; males are the fastest, females are a bit slower, babies are really slow and should be accompanied by females.  However, when you finally get back to Winter Range, you score more for babies and females than you do for males -- so you may find it necessary to sacrifice a male or two to predators.  Predators are controlled by your opponents, but you get to control them on your turn.  They are not major threats, but inducement to keep moving.  Collect those food points!  You'll need them for winter.<br/>The game's map centers on the Yellowstone Park area and some of the land south of there.<br/><br/>",

Movement is determined by dice roll as is combat when the player's piece is in the same square as a Zombie. Players must conserve bullets and protect their life counters. At the end of the turn a dice roll directs the player to move a number of Zombies one square (because they are the slow George Romero type).<br/><br/>First player to reach the center of the Helipad tile and kill the Zombie there, or kill a total of 25 Zombies wins. When a player is killed they move back to the starting tile and lose half their Zombie kills.<br/><br/>Zombies!!! is the original game in the Zombies!!! series.<br/><br/>",

It's probably nothing. Who ever heard of a zombie dog anyway?<br/><br/>The goal of Zombies!!! 4: The End is to be the first player to successfully &quot;undo&quot; the spell that is making the dead rise. To do this, you need to find as many pages from the Book of the Undead as possible; make it to the cabin and perform the spell before the other players &mdash; but watch out for the &quot;dead&quot; dogs.<br/><br/>This standalone expansion, for two to six players, features an ever changing map and an always hungry pack of undead dogs. Players take turns playing map tiles, placing zombies, running furiously, screaming, fighting and generally creating havoc. Zombies!!! 4 can be played alone or combined with any other Zombies!!! set(s).<br/><br/>",

It also has counters with no ratings.  In some ways, it&rsquo;s like cardboard miniatures &hellip; with fewer rules. The game system highlights the firepower of the British Martini Henry rifle, the value of a solid defensive position, and the greatly superior numbers of the three Zulu amabutho that gave them something like forty-to-one numerical superiority.<br/><br/>Even so, each British counter represents one man, and we have identified each with his name and unit. Zulu combat counters represent about 25-30 men, but that usage is not literal, given the unusual system. The map scale is 1&rdquo; = 4 yards. The mechanics cover such facets of the engagement as Zulu fire from the Oskarberg terraces, the Hospital and its patients, the pros and cons of setting fire to that building, even possible heroics by the very men who earned Victoria Crosses for their actions during the battle.<br/><br/>The game also includes scenarios on  Isandlwana &amp; Kambula.<br/><br/>",
